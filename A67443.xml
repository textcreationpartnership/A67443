            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>t in hopes of it. For 'tis undeniably a guilty preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me to make bold with Your Royal Name, and that to a ſlight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or at leaſt made ſo by ill handling; ſuch as will give People too
<pb facs="tcp:102628:3"/> much reaſon to ſay, Your Name is the only thing, which ſhews handſom in the whole <hi>Proſpect.</hi> Neither have I any, but the ſorry excuſe of defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs guilt: I was drawn in, though not by others, by Counſellors as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deceitful as my own thoughts. I conſidered that This, in the original deſign, was part of a Book which has the honour to be made Your's, and thought my altering the Method did not alter Your Majeſties Property; neither could I conceive, when Your Name appear'd on the one half, any but Yours could ſhew well on the other. I conſidered that 'tis an account of part of Your People, and contains an account of part of Your Pedigree. To the King, and to the Head of the Family, Juſtice I thought appropriated both, For it is the glory of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation to have contributed to Your Sacred Blood, as well as the reſt under Your happy Government: and when they ſhed their own in Your defence, to know
<pb facs="tcp:102628:3"/> they ſpend an inconſiderable part for preſervation of the moſt Noble and moſt Precious: a ſweeter and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a ſtronger tye than the Duty of Subjects. As reciprocally, Nature with its ſecret allurements of propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards a Country, from whence we are derived, and where our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours have lived great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, joyns with the common care of a King, and Father of all his People, to move Your Majeſty to cheriſh them with the reſt. Thus much I beg leave to ſay by the by in behalf of my Native Countrey, becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Writer has not been either ſo curious to obſerve, or ſo kind to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it. But leaving that matter, theſe reaſons perſuaded me I might find at leaſt Companions in my fault, and where Your Sacred Name has been made bold with as improperly. Yet what wrought moſt, was a ſtrong temptation, and which I could the leſs reſiſt, becauſe it came in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
<pb facs="tcp:102628:4"/> of gratitude, to appear as little unworthy, as I could, of many and ſignal effects of Your Goodneſs. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body knows I am deeply in Your Debt, and I thought it but juſt every body ſhould know I own it, with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>enſe which becomes me; though I have not hitherto ſaid ſo much as bare, I thank you, no not to Your Majeſty Your ſelf ſometimes. The thoughts of Death, which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns a man of my age to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, would be too terrible to me, if it ſhould carry me away with the imputation of an inſenſible or ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

As I have always thought the beſt return a Subject can make to the favours of his Prince, is by his ſervice to deſerve them; I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the comfort, that I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach my ſelf with not having done my beſt. But alas! I muſt ſay to You as to God, after all I have, to my great grief, been but an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſervant. That thought is a
<pb facs="tcp:102628:4"/> miſery, which I am ill able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Should Ungrateful be added to Uſeleſs, it would certainly and ſoon ſink my gray hairs to the Grave. Fear of this, as fear ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces boldneſs, has caſt me into that, of which I am now guilty, and in which my ill Fate ſtill purſues me. For I am uſeleſs now too, having with much pains got a Preſent to make You, for which neither Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, nor any body elſe perhaps will be the better, and I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worth more, than juſt ſo much Paper. But yet 'tis all I can do. For we of the Scribling Trade are like Merchants who trade upon cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and pay altogether in Bills. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that in truth, there lives not perhaps the man, whoſe ſtock, or luck in managing it is great enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the mighty ſum I owe You. Theſe were the thoughts which ſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd my preſumption with hopes of Pardon, to which all even Your Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb facs="tcp:102628:5"/> will yet be needful. For I am an unrepenting Sinner, and who, far from ſorrow, glory in the fault which gives me an occaſion to tell all the World, I have lived and mean to die,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>EADER, You may well imagine by the <hi>Title</hi> and Method of this Treatiſe, the Author was very far from intending, it ſhould paſs for a Hiſtory of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And for the Bulk I can aſſure you, that although, conſidering the extent of Times, and variety of Matters treated of therein, it be but little; yet, according to his firſt deſign, it ſhould have been far leſs, at leaſt by five parts of ſix.</p>
            <p>The truth is, I never had a thought of writing a word on this Subject, before the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven</hi> deſired, nor only deſired but importun'd me a twelve month paſt, when his Lordſhip's <hi>Memoir's</hi> had been a working off the Preſs, that I would draw an Appendix to be publiſh'd with them, which might in ſhort repreſent the original
<pb facs="tcp:102628:6"/> Cauſe of the <hi>Rebellion</hi> broke out in <hi>Ireland</hi> on the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>October, 1641.</hi> and conſequently ſomewhat of the <hi>State</hi> of that Kingdom, and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Feud</hi> betwixt the two Nations there, ſince <hi>Henry II's</hi> time.</p>
            <p>What little inclination I had to the Subject, it will be to no purpoſe I ſhould tell, being you ſee I was at laſt perſuaded: though nevertheleſs I muſt acknowledg, it was only the power this Nobleman has, and can juſtly challenge over me, <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Caſtle-Haven</hi>'s Memoir's pag. 87.</note> wrought my acquieſcence to his deſires. But laying aſide that matter, what I would next inform you of are theſe particulars. 1. That although eight or nine ſheets in the Whole, was the moſt I had firſt deſign'd to write (becauſe a larger Tract could not ſo well ſuit the Title of an <hi>Appendix</hi> to his Lordſhip's <hi>Memoir's:</hi>) yet when I was once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd on the Subject, ſo great a variety of matters offer'd themſelves to conſideration, as took up more time and paper than I firſt intended. 2. That in the mean while ſome Copies of the ſaid <hi>Memoir</hi>'s chancing (by ſome unexpected accident) to be given out by the Book-ſeller: my Lord, conſidering he could not otherwiſe prevent a ſiniſter interpretation of his meaning by them in the main, as they were ſeen thus imperfect, found himſelf neceſſitated not only not to ſtay my leiſure; but inſtead of ſuch an Appendix as he
<pb facs="tcp:102628:6"/> expected from me, to change his former Preface, and write and print another; with an Appendix alſo of his own, though upon another Subject: and with ſuch both amendments and accompliſhments as he thought neceſſary, to order the free expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his Book to publick view. 3. That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I had on this emergent occaſion thought my ſelf eas'd of any further ſtudy on a Subject I had no liking to, it prov'd much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For his Lordſhip nevertheleſs continued his deſires that I ſhould proſecute and finiſh what I had begun: and to oblige me to it, without hopes of any change in him, gave notice in his Preface to the Reader of his <hi>Memoir's,</hi> how the Appendix he had firſt intended and promis'd of the <hi>State of Ireland</hi> was grown to ſuch a Bulk as would require its coming out in a Book by its ſelf. And therefore I found my ſelf more deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd. 4. That, however, ſeeing I was now at more liberty, as for Time, ſo for Matter and for Title both, I reſolv'd to change my firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſo few ſheets, and write under the Title of a <hi>Proſpect,</hi> &amp;c. about threeſcore ſheets in all: but in the ſame method and Stile I had already begun with, as more agreeable to my purpoſe of giving (though not a ſtrict much leſs a full Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, yet) the choiceſt Collections, and freeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations too, I could derive from, or in my way, <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſeveral, eaſie, plain Diſcourſes make upon the <hi>Hiſtory of Ireland;</hi> Thirty ſheets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
<pb facs="tcp:102628:7"/> in ſhort the ſtate of that Kingdom from the firſt Plantation of it after the Flood, till the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conqueſt: and the other thirty what follow'd ſince for the laſt five hundred years. 5. That becauſe I conſidered the <hi>Form</hi> (as <hi>Printers</hi> call it) which I had alſo begun with already, and therefore muſt have continued the ſame, would be too narrow and little for a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of ſixty ſheets, not rendred unproportinoably thick: I give them divided as in two Parts, which I call the <hi>Former</hi> and <hi>Later,</hi> ſo in two Volums, each apart. So much for the Occaſion, Title, Method, Form, Diviſion of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe matters of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Antiquity, ſo ſtrangely far out of our ken, diſcours'd in this <hi>Former Part,</hi> I doubt not, ſome at leaſt, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure many of 'em will be excepted againſt by Criticks in this cenſorious Age. And that, where nothing elſe can be objected, <hi>Varro's</hi> Three Differences of Time muſt ſerve the turn. We ſhall be told, How the <hi>Firſt,</hi> having been That which extended from the Creation to the Flood, is call'd <hi>Obſcure</hi> and <hi>uncertain:</hi> becauſe we are wholly ignorant of all things happen'd in it. The <hi>Second,</hi> which was That from the Flood to the firſt <hi>Olympiad,</hi> is termed Fabulous: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a world of Fables reported thereof. But the <hi>Third,</hi> extending frem the ſaid <hi>Olympiad</hi> to our days, is called <hi>Hiſtorical:</hi> becauſe the Acts of it are delivered in Hiſtories that are true.
<pb facs="tcp:102628:7"/> And indeed, I muſt confeſs that ſo ſaid <hi>Varro</hi> (the moſt learned of the <hi>Romans 1700</hi> years ago) following herein the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and after him (of late) our Engliſh <hi>Cambden,</hi> who lays ſo much ſtreſs upon this obſervation of <hi>Varro,</hi> that (<hi>page 17. Hol. Tranſlat.</hi>) he makes it his only argument to ruin the credit of <hi>Geoffrey of Monmouth</hi>'s new Hiſtory of <hi>Brute.</hi> But withal I do profeſs, that, for my own part, I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it that ſtreſſes. My reaſons are, 1. The ſayings of <hi>Varro,</hi> how learned ſoever he was, are no Oracles. 2. The Hiſtories of the Jewiſh Nation, at leaſt the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſeveral more of the Old Teſtament Record a great variety of Matters hapned, ſome before the Flood, many more after it, both the one and the other with all certainty and truth imaginable; and yet all of 'em before the Firſt <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which according to <hi>Cambden</hi> himſelf was no earlier than the year of the World 3189. though others make it earlier by fifteen years. 3. And to wave all kind of advantages from thoſe holy Books which both Jews and Chriſtians repute infallible, as being the Oracles of God; <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Appion,</hi> a Book written by him 1600. years ago, aſſures us, that even the Hiſtories of the <hi>Phenicians, Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> have recorded likewiſe with great truth and certainty the Reigns of their own Kings, and other memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things happen'd in their Countreys many
<pb facs="tcp:102628:8"/> hundred years before the firſt <hi>Olympiad;</hi> yea not a few of them happen'd even long before either <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was born. 4. There have been ſeveral Books written for true Hiſtory of matters that (as the Authors would make us believe) happen'd ſince the firſt <hi>Olympiad,</hi> nay written partly of ſome things reported in them to have happen'd fourteen hundred years after that <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which yet we know to be moſt facu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.

            <p>But to return back to <hi>Joſephus;</hi> it is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable how (in the ſame Book againſt <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi>) he wonders not a little at thoſe who as to matters of Antiquity, ſuppoſe the truth ought only to be gather'd from the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Whereas indeed (ſays he) whatever is written by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is new, and of late memory, and has been done in the World in a manner but yeſterday. And this he proves in the ſame place at large. Beſides he ſhews, that albeit their knowledg or practice not only of other Arts and Sciences, but of any kind of Letters, had been very late; yet the lateſt of all among 'em was that of Hiſtory. That herein, even after they had given themſelves induſtriouſly to it, they were notwithſtanding very imperfect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, ſhort: their chiefeſt Authors contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another in what they wrote: (as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:102628:8"/> there were no ancient Records, not even in <hi>Athens</hi> it ſelf, to check their falſity, nor Laws to curb their Liberty of writing what they pleas'd at random) and what they wrote, being ſo little as to other Countreys of the World, that of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, though very powerful within <hi>Italy</hi> in thoſe times, and ſo near home, they ſeem'd for ſome Ages wholly ignorant. That even their moſt curious Writers, and among 'em <hi>Ephorus</hi> by name, were ſo ignorant of the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> as to have thought the later a People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated of one only City, and related the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners both of the one and the other to be ſuch, as neither are nor at any time were among either. Finally, that their knowledg of other Nations was a long time ſo extream little, as to have extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to the bordering <hi>Thracians,</hi> and the Inhabitants of the Sea Coaſts, lying Eaſterly, and Weſterly, not far from <hi>Greece;</hi> all other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or untraffiquing, nay and all traſſiquing too, ſo they were far remote Countreys, being utterly unknown to them.</p>
            <p>Moreover, and more nearly to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it is obſervable how ſo excellent, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſs'd a Writer, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> undoubtedly is, not only has in the ſame Book this very expreſſion, That <hi>he preſumes not for matter of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity to compare his own Jewiſh Nation</hi> with the <hi>Chaldeans, Egyptians,</hi> or <hi>Phaenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> but, for certainty and truth, highly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates
<pb facs="tcp:102628:9"/> in particular, the Phenician Hiſtorian <hi>Dius,</hi> and the Chaldean <hi>Beroſus.</hi> And yet we know from him, that as well the one as the other of theſe two Writers has treated of the Affairs of that ſecond Difference of Time in <hi>Varro,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Beroſus.</hi> He tells us that <hi>Beroſus,</hi> both mentioned the Flood, and Ark, and reſting of this on the Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and continued the ſeries of his Narration downwards all along from the firſt of Kings after the Deluge, even from <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf, that is, for the whole extent of that very Second period or Difference of Time. Whence it muſt follow, that however this Time might well and juſtly be reputed <hi>fabulous</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi> in relation to themſelves and their own Hiſtorians; yet their ignorance ought to be no rule to conclude other Nations that, like to thoſe ancient <hi>Egyptians, Phaenicians,</hi> and his <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> were from the beginning careful to preſerve their Antiquities, <hi>i. e.</hi> their Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, Adventures, Changes, Kings, Wars, and other Memorable Deeds, in publick Regiſters on Record for Poſterity. Such are at preſent the <hi>Chineſes</hi> in the utmoſt limit of the old World in <hi>Aſia</hi> towards the Riſing Sun: as the Hiſtory of <hi>Martinus a Martinis</hi> abundantly ſheweth. And that ſuch alſo in the fartheſt Land of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> towards the Setting Sun, the ancient <hi>Iriſh</hi> have been while their State continued till about five hundred years ſince, may be ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by many arguments. Among which are
<pb facs="tcp:102628:9"/> thoſe which you may briefly read in this <hi>Proſpect, Former Part, Sect. II. page 46, 47,</hi> and 48. whereunto it will not be amiſs to add what both <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> and <hi>Neubrigenſis</hi> do confeſs, that even from the beginning the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation has ever continued free from any forein Yoak or Conqueſt till <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s time. That is, according to <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> has continued ſo, even for ſo long an extent of time as the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Reigns of a hundred eighty one Monarchs of their own Countrey and extraction from the ſame ſtock had certainly taken up. And therefore it muſt be alſo confeſs'd, That ſo long at leaſt, they were in a capacity to preſerve their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. And ſo indeed they did preſerve the chiefeſt of 'em ſafe, even amidſt the greateſt fury of the two <hi>Daniſh</hi> Wars. Neither of which, how deſtructive, calamitous and heavy ſoever, eſpecially the Former was, arrived to the nature of an abſolute or total Conqueſt of the Natives, not even for one week or day.</p>
            <p>All which conſider'd by indifferent men, I hope may be enough to remove out of their way all prejudgment of Criticks, from the foreſaid obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Varro,</hi> againſt thoſe remote Antiquities of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, which you ſhall meet with in the <hi>Former Part</hi> of this <hi>Proſpect.</hi>

Though, I muſt confeſs, I am ſtill the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, that while I was drawing theſe Papers you have now before you, I could by no means procure the Reading either of Primat <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher's <hi>Primordia Eccleſiarum Britannicarum,</hi> or Sir James Ware's <hi>Antiquities of Ireland.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſeeing I have expos'd my ſelf to cenſure, as relying wholly on the ability and ſincerity of <hi>Keting</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> in the performance of their ſeveral undertakings: I have the more reaſon to give here this following true account of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geoffrey Keting</hi> was a Native of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> as were his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours before him for many Generations, though not of <hi>Iriſh</hi> but <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood originally. He was by Education, Study, Gommencement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in <hi>France,</hi> a Doctor of Divinity; in his Religion, a <hi>Romaniſt;</hi> by Ordination and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a ſecular Prieſt. He had by his former ſtudy at home in his younger days, under the beſt Maſters of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tongue and the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:102628:11"/> skilful in their Antiquities, arriv'd to a high degree of knowledg in both. In his riper years, when return'd back from his other Studies and Travails in Forein Parts, his curioſity and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius led him to examin all Foreign Authors, both Ancient and Modern, who had written of that Kingdom either purpoſely or occaſionally, whether in <hi>Latin</hi> or in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch made him obſerve two things chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 1. That every one, even the very beſt and moſt knowing of thoſe Writers, were either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly out in many, if not moſt of their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the State of that Countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Engliſh Conqueſt,</hi> or rather indeed wholly ignorant of it. In ſo much, that like men groping in the dark, they related ſcarce any thing at all, well or ill, of what had paſs'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland</hi> far above one and Thirty Hundred years. Except only what is by ſome of them reported of the Learning and Sanctimony of their Monks, during the firſt fervours of Chriſtianity: and a very little more of their Wars at home in <hi>Ireland</hi> with the <hi>Danes;</hi> and even this very little involv'd in a mixture of Monſtrous Fables, derived from ſuch Romantick Stories, as were certainly written at firſt for meer diverſion and paſtime only. 2. That the generality of thoſe <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Authors, who have written of that Countrey ſince the <hi>Engliſh Conqueſt,</hi> are againſt all Juſtice and Truth,
<pb facs="tcp:102628:11"/> and Law's of Hiſtory, in the higheſt degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the ancient Natives. Theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations improving by a fervent zeal for truth, and generous love to his Countrey, made Father <hi>Keting</hi> undergo the laborious task of writing the <hi>Hiſtory of Ireland</hi> at large from the very firſt Plantation of it after the Deluge to <hi>Hen. II</hi>'s time and 17th year of his Reign, being the year of Chriſt 1152. And this Hiſtory (beſides which there is no other full, compleat or metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical one extant of all the Ages, Invaſions, Conqueſts, Changes, Monarchs, Wars, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiderable matters of that truly ancient Kingdom) be lived to finiſh in his old Age, that is, a little after <hi>Charles I.</hi> of glorious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory had been proclaimed King. Nor did he only finiſh it, but prefix unto it a very judicious, large and learned Preface to the Reader. It is in this Preface he declares thoſe two ſpecial motives of his writing, which you have ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Where alſo he declares who thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are that gave him the occaſion, and refutes them one after another at large: namely, <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, Solinus, Pomponius Mela,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom</hi> againſt <hi>Jovinian, Cambrenſis, Stanihurſt, Campion, Hanmer, Cambden, Hector Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius, John Barclay, Moriſon, Davies, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan.</hi> All theſe in particular, as to ſome paſſages of theirs, he diſputes againſt in the ſame Preface with the cleareſt evidence of Authority,
<pb facs="tcp:102628:12"/> matter of Fact, and Reaſon grounded on both. As likewiſe he does in the Body of his Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other paſſages not only of ſome of theſe ſame Authors, eſpecially <hi>Cambrenſis, Hector Boethius,</hi> and <hi>Buchanan,</hi> but <hi>Nicholas San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> too in his Firſt Book <hi>de Schiſmate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicano.</hi> Beſides in the ſame Preface he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes five or ſix other Particulars, which I think worth the while not to paſs over wholly in ſilence.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That although in his Hiſtory he has not ſeldom made uſe of ſome Collections out of Foreign Writers; yet the main Body of it all along is compos'd out of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ancient and authentick Monuments of <hi>Ireland,</hi> viz. <hi>Pſaltuir Ardemach, Pſaltuir Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſil, Pſaltuir na Rann</hi> (written by <hi>Aon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghuis Ceile De</hi>) and then <hi>Leabhar na Hua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congmhala, Leabhar Chluaino Huighnioch, Leabhar Fiontain</hi> in Leix, <hi>Leabhar Ghlinne</hi> Da-Loch, <hi>Leabhar B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idhe Mholing, Leabhar Dubh Mholaige, Leabhar na Gceart</hi> (writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by S. <hi>Benignus</hi>) and <hi>Ubhdir Chiarrain,</hi> writ at <hi>Cluain-mhac-Noiſe:</hi> in all Thirteen Books. For you are to underſtand here not only that <hi>Leabhar</hi> ſignifies a Book, and <hi>Pſaltuir</hi> (we call it <hi>Pſaltor</hi>) a Book in Verſe, but, as he ſays, That from the beginning it was the cuſtom of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to have their Chief Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties done into the choiſeſt, ſevereſt, ſtricteſt Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="tcp:102628:12"/> without any redundance or want as to ſenſe and point of truth: and this as well for the more ſafe preſerving of them from corruption, as the more eaſie getting them by heart. And conſequently you ſee the true reaſon why their chief Records of <hi>Tarach, Caſhel, Ardmagh,</hi> &amp;c. are called <hi>Pſalters.</hi> But if you would further know the heads of theſe thirteen Books: he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in the ſame place, They are theſe. 1. The ſeveral Invaſions and Conqueſts of <hi>Ireland.</hi> 2. The Diviſion of its Provinces and leſſer Countreys. 3. The Reigns of their Kings. 4. Their Annals. 5. Their Computations and Concordances of Times. 6. The Genealogy of their Male Gentry. 7. The Pedigree of their Females. 8. Their Vocabulary. Where alſo is a large account of the great School in the Plain of <hi>Sennaar,</hi> and three firſt Teachers of it, ſoon after the Confuſion of Tongues at <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s Tower. 9. The Viſions of <hi>Columb-Cille,</hi> with ſundry other Antiquities of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Particular gives in effect four Reaſons, or at leaſt one compos'd of ſo many Heads, to perſuade the credibility and truth of theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Books. It tells us of above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred chief Chronologers together, from very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly times, conttinuing a Succeſſion in the ſame Families and all Ages in that Nation while their Kingdom ſtood, whoſe peculiar and only Office it was to record faithfully all memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="tcp:102628:13"/> Concerns. It tells us how theſe Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had ſufficient Eſtates in Land entail'd on themſelves and Iſſue for ever on that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It tells us of the publick Schools they had purpoſely and continually kept for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of their Youth in the knowledge of their Antiquities: and how theſe Schools were kept in the Countrey of <hi>Breifthne,</hi> as they call in <hi>Iriſh</hi> That which now we call the County of <hi>Letrim.</hi> It tells us of a Triennial ſearch into and Reviſion of all their Records by a ſelect Committee in the Publick Aſſembly of all the Eſtates of that Kingdom. And laſtly, it tells us of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of fair Copies of the ſame Records, in the hands of the Biſhops from time to time ever ſince the Nation believed in Chriſt 1200 years ſince. Whereof you may ſee more at large in my <hi>46. page</hi> following in this <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third Particular anſwers the Objection of ſome diſcordance among the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Books, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the number of years from the Creation of the World to the Birth of our Saviour. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the Objectors to conſider the far greater diſcordance <note n="*" place="margin">Becauſe I was not ſure that my Copy of <hi>Keting</hi> was right in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars or <hi>Diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances</hi> noted here, I conſulted of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sixtus Senen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> l. 5. <hi>Bibl.

<pb facs="tcp:102628:13"/> 
               <hi>Paul Sedecholim</hi> counts 3518. years: the <hi>Talmudiſts, 3784.</hi> the <hi>New Rabbins, 3760. Rabbi Naaſſon, 3740. Rabbi Moſes Germidiſi, 4058. Joſephus, 4192.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodorus, 5000. Euſebius, 5199. Theophilus, 5476.</hi> And among the Latins, <hi>S.

Alphonſus, 5984.</hi> Now, ſays <hi>Keting,</hi> if ſo great a diſcordance on this very Subject impair not in other matters the credit of either <hi>Greek, Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Authors: why ſhould it the <hi>Iriſh?</hi> Where alſo he acquaints his Reader, that becauſe himſelf is of opinion, that ſuch <hi>Iriſh</hi> Antiquaries or Books as count for this Period from the Creation to the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 4052. <note n="*" place="margin">This is the Computation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by <hi>Auguſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Tornlellius</hi> in his <hi>Annales Sacri ab Orbe Condito ad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum paſſum.</hi> Sext. <hi>M.</hi> Aetat. ad an. 4052. whether <hi>Keting</hi> had him for his Maſter, though I know not; yet I know he might, becauſe <hi>Torniellius</hi> came out in Print at <hi>Francford,</hi> an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1611.</note> come neareſt the Truth, he follows them in his Hiſtory, or computation of times therein, either precedent or ſubſequent to the Birth of Chriſt. And farther, in the
<pb facs="tcp:102628:14"/> ſome place, he acquaints us with his purpoſe to give at the end of his Hiſtory an Appendix, or a Table of <hi>Synchroniſm,</hi> ſhewing what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, Monarchs, Great Kings of the World in other parts, and ſince Chriſtianity what Popes and general Councils were contemporary with the various Revolutions and Kings of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether he lived to finiſh this Table, I know not. But I remember to have ſeen, in ſtead thereof, two ſmall Tracts of his in <hi>Iriſh,</hi> on another Subject, annexed to an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Copy of his Hiſtory: the one being a Defence of the <hi>Maſs;</hi> the other entitl'd in Iriſh, <hi>The Three Shafts of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An other Particular is That which tells how, and why, he thought it fitting, as to the number of years attributed to the ſeveral Reigns of ſome few of their Pagan Monarchs, eſpecially <hi>Siorna Saoghallach,</hi> and <hi>Cobhthach Caolbh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reag,</hi> to vary from their Book of Reigns where it's ſaid, That the later reign'd fifty years; but the former a hundred and fifty, and that beſides he was a hundred years old when he attain'd the Sovereignty, nor died naturally, but was murder'd after he had lived two hundred and fifty years in all.</p>
            <p>In the Fifth Particular, he ſpeaks only to thoſe who ſeem rather to admire than believe how it can be at leaſt probable, That other Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees than thoſe in Holy Scripture ſhould be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:102628:14"/> and in a perpetual Line without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption carried up along to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Genealogical and Hiſtorical Books pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do for all their Kings, Princes, and great Nobles. To ſuch admiring incredulous men he anſwers, That the <hi>Iriſhry</hi> or <hi>Gathelian</hi> Off-ſpring, even all along from the time of <hi>Gathelus</hi> himſelf (whoſe name gave theſe Deſcendants from hin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That the more famous Branch of thoſe <hi>Gathelians,</hi> to wit the <hi>Clanna Mileadh</hi> or Deſcendents from <hi>Mileſius</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> after they had conquer'd <hi>Ireland</hi> from the Nation call'd <hi>Tuatha-De-Danann</hi> thought fit to continue the ſame courſe, and accordingly did continue for the 2500 years of their Government and Laws, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted numerous ſucceſſion of Antiquaries for the ſame purpoſe, with large allowance and ſtrict orders to regulate them; us has been ſaid afore. That beſides, and particularly to ſhew the like care among ſome other Nations for preſerving the Genealogies of their great Heroes; he inſtances in the Pedegree of that excellent <hi>Saxon</hi> King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredus,</hi> and out of <hi>Aſſer Menevenſis</hi> inſerts it

For about five or ſix and forty years ſince, travelling in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and within a little <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile to <hi>Lovain,</hi> entring the Choire of the <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin's</hi> Abbey there, I ſaw and for a pretty while did view a Table hung up on the Wall, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of the Illuſtrious Founders the Dukes of <hi>Arſcot,</hi> carried up in like manner through a vaſt number of Generations to the Firſt of all men. Which may be enough to perſuade us, that the old <hi>German Nation,</hi> how meanly ſoever for matter of civility or Learning, deſcrib'd by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> have been very careful in preſerving at leaſt their Genealogical Antiquities. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if my memory fail me not, I remember to have read in <hi>Favins</hi> Theatre of Honour, much to this purpoſe; where he tells, It was from the <hi>Germans</hi> that all the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> derived the cuſtom of giving Goats of Arms to ſhew the Noble Antiquity of their Extraction. Though withal I muſt confeſs, that <hi>Keting</hi> in the Reign of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarch <hi>Domhnal mhac Aodh mhic Ainmhire,</hi> who died in the year of Chriſt 642. not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates by a very ſpecial Inſtance, That cuſtom of blazoning Arms to have been among the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in this Monarchs Reign very common, but farther ſays, It had been ſo in all Ages before, among
<pb facs="tcp:102628:15"/> their Anceſtours, ever ſince the days of <hi>Gathelus</hi> himſelf, who deriv'd it from the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the time of their paſſing the Red Sea, when each of the Tribes had its own peculiar Enſign carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But to return to my purpoſe:</p>
            <p>The Sixth and Laſt of thoſe particulars (of <hi>Keting</hi>'s Preface) I would acquaint you with, is That, being his whole Hiſtory for the matter, is only of the Ancient <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, if any Reader ſhall perhaps apprehend his Relations, or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations or praiſes of them any where, or in any point, or as to any matter or Times, exceſſive: he deſires it be conſidered, That the Author is no <hi>Iriſh</hi> man by blood, but <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though born in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And therefore cannot rationally be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to magnifie the <hi>Old Iriſh,</hi> or ſpeak more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things of 'em, than the very force of Truth and duty of a Hiſtorian exacts from him. Beſides he had immediately before, in the ſame Place, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, That neither love nor hatred of any People, nor hope of any kind of Reward on Earth, made him either go through with, or indeed at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo any part of the toil of ſo laborious a Work, but only thoſe other conſiderations given before. But what his reaſon was only to write it in <hi>Iriſh;</hi> I cannot tell. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſ it be, That he would not ſwerve from the cuſtom of that Nation, while they were a free People before the <hi>Engliſh Conqueſt,</hi> of tranſmitting the Authentick Records or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Acts and Monuments of their Kingdom to
<pb facs="tcp:102628:16"/> after Ages in their own Language only. Which as I conceive, is the true reaſon why ſo little of them has ever yet been known elſwhere in the World. However you have by this time a ſufficient account of <hi>Keting,</hi> the Author I am moſtly guided by in the whole <hi>Former Part</hi> of my <hi>Proſpect,</hi> or (which is the ſame thing) in my Diſcourſes of the State of <hi>Ireland</hi> till the beginning of the <hi>Engliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt</hi> in the year of Chriſt, 1172.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgotten to prevent your prejudice againſt <hi>Keting</hi>'s Hiſtory, from his relating about the beginning of it, thoſe three unlikely Stories. 1. How <hi>Seth</hi> the Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> and three daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Cain</hi> in a Company together landed in, and view'd all <hi>Ireland</hi> over. 2. How laſt year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Deluge three Fiſhermen of <hi>South-Spain,</hi> by name <hi>Laigne, Capa,</hi> and <hi>Luaſad,</hi> had been Wind-driven thither, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. How <hi>Keaſar,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Baioth</hi> ſon to <hi>Noah,</hi> with three men, viz. <hi>Fionntuin, Lothra,</hi> and her ſaid Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fifty Women, to ſave themſelves from the Flood, which from <hi>Noah</hi> they had heard of as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, after they had firſt by her advice renounc'd the God of <hi>Noah,</hi> taken to themſelves an Idol God, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in their Language call <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbh Dhia,</hi> and then wandred for ſeven years by Sea, at laſt arriv'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> juſt forty days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, and there nevertheleſſ periſh'd by it. And indeed I muſt confeſſ that <hi>Keting</hi> relates theſe Stories at large, with all their other circumſtances.
<pb facs="tcp:102628:16"/> But how or why does he relate'em? It is manifeſt he does it, of ſet purpoſe to explode 'em every one as incredible, and meer Poetical Fictions. For ſo himſelf expreſly ſays. Adding withal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſuch only and no other was the repute they had in the very days of Yore among the beſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And for this he brings ſufficient proofs, by alledging their own words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> is the next Author I make frequent uſe of to lead me in ſeveral remote affairs of the more <hi>Ancient Iriſh.</hi> And he likewiſe an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man by birth; but of the Province of <hi>Connaght,</hi> and (as himſelf profeſſes) by name and blood of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Extraction. His own proper name and ſurname, <hi>John Lynch:</hi> his Function, Sacerdotal, and of the Secular Clergy too. His employ beſides at <hi>Galway,</hi> for ſome years in our own time, was Teaching a School of <hi>Humanity,</hi> (as they call it) wherein he was excellent. In the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Roman Catholic Confederates</hi> in the late unhappy War of that Nation, he join'd with thoſe of them that were againſt the <hi>Nuncio Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuccini</hi>'s Cenſures, for the Ceſſation with <hi>Inchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> ſubmiſſion to the King, and the <hi>two Peaces.</hi> After the ſurrender of <hi>Galway</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament Army he went to <hi>France.</hi> Where, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying his time as became a good Patriot &amp; Loyal Subject, he wrote, printed and publiſh'd two <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Books in <hi>Quarto,</hi> with a Dedicatory Epiſtle to the <hi>Congregation of Cardinals de Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda
<pb facs="tcp:102628:17"/> Fide,</hi> againſt a Factious diſloyal Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript which one <hi>Richard Ferral</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Capuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> had ſome years before written and preſented to the ſame Congregation, as a Direction for them in their government of the Church affairs of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> the former entitled <hi>Alithinologia;</hi> the Later, <hi>Supplementum Alithinologiae.</hi> Some years after, that is <hi>an. 1662.</hi> he publiſh'd under the name of <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> an other <hi>Latin</hi> Work in Folio, intitled <hi>Cambrenſis Everſus,</hi> as being a full confutation of the Author that goes by the name of <hi>Cambrenſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who this <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> and what the Quarrel was, to let you know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I digreſs a little, it may peradventure be worth the while. His proper name and ſurname in <hi>Engliſh</hi> being <hi>Gerald Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that Additional of <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> he had from his native Countrey, in Latin <hi>Cambria,</hi> in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh <hi>Wales.</hi> His education of a Scholar, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Divine, Function of a Prieſt, and (as I muſt ſuppoſe) merits in all brought him in time to be not only Arch-deacon of S. <hi>Davids,</hi> but Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the young Earl of <hi>Mortaign</hi> Fifth Son to <hi>Henry II.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder which Qualifications, firſt his zeal for the old Archiepiſcopal privileges of that See engag'd him in a long Conteſt with the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and then his Election to the ſame See of S. <hi>Davids,</hi> involv'd him in another. In ſo much, that however he came to be worſted in both (for ſo he was) yet his name has ever ſince remain'd on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb facs="tcp:102628:17"/> in the Papal Canons. His extraction made him Nephew to <hi>Robert fitz Stephens</hi> and <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice fitz Gerald,</hi> Couſin to <hi>Meylerus,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Philip Barry</hi> and <hi>Robert Barry,</hi> five of the firſt chief men that adventured to <hi>Ireland</hi> of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to advance their own fortune by helping on the Reſtauration of <hi>Diarmuid na Ngall</hi> King of <hi>Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> His own Genius once, and once more his Place carried him to <hi>Ireland.</hi> For twice he was there: firſt to ſee his kinſmen daily acquiring large poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by their valour: and next to wait on his young Prince Earl <hi>John,</hi> when created Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſent thither by the King. And now, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes, being deſirous of glory and immortal fame by deſcribing <hi>Ireland,</hi> and informing the World not only of what he knew of the State of that Kingdom then under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conquerors, but of all former Conqueſts, and State thereof from the beginning, he wrote to this purpoſe five Books in <hi>Latin.</hi> The firſt three of 'em under the Title of <hi>The Topography of Ireland,</hi> and the other two under that of <hi>The Conqueſt of Ireland</hi> by <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry II.</hi> Indeed more ſpecious Titles both, than his Relations under them do ſo much as meanly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Beſides, that the Title at leaſt of <hi>Topo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy</hi> muſt be very ſtrangely applyed to ſignifie the <hi>Deſcription</hi> of a whole Kingdom. And yet notwitſtanding, This, together with the Hiſtory of all former Conqueſts and other Antiquities of <hi>Ireland,</hi> is that which he promiſes to give under the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:102628:18"/> Title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he has very ill perform'd, that he has given his Reader's nothing leſs than ſuch a Hiſtory or ſuch a Deſcription<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we muſt not wonder. He neither could underſtand the Language, nor ſo much as read the Books whether of Hiſtory or Chorography written at large by the Natives themſelves in their own Character. He ſaw not in any manner, nor travel'd, nor view'd e'en at a diſtance, above one Third of the Kingdom, nor dar'd for his Life ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into either of the other two parts. His whole ſtay in <hi>Ireland,</hi> being the whole extent of Yime em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by him in gathering materials for his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was but a year and a half; beſides an other half years task<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he had left to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion <hi>Bertram Verdon,</hi> who therefore ſtay'd ſo long behind him. His Collections, at leaſt for ſuch part of 'em as any way pertinently related to his foreſaid promiſe, or Titles, were certainly extream little; but the reſt of them, no leſs extream bad, and commonly falſe to boot. They were ſo little, that he deſcribes not ſo much as one County, or Tract, or Town, no not of that very third Part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which he might have ſeen. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you take for a Deſcription of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Fabulous Narrations of four Wells, three Iſlands, three Lakes, the Fountain head of four great Rivers, and the Fall of the greateſt of them all, by name the River of <hi>Shannon,</hi> into the Northern Sea. Tho it be well known, That as all theſe Narrations are ſuch, <hi>i. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As for the Hiſtory of the former Inhabitants, Conqueſts, and other Antiquities of that Kingdom, promiſed by him, it is in like manner not only ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, but ſo little in all reſpects: That 1. he has not the leaſt mention of <hi>Tuatha-De-Danainn,</hi> though a powerful People that by a bloody War en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely won it from <hi>Feara-Bolg,</hi> and were poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it for a hundred ninty ſeven Years under the ſucceſſive Reigns of ſeven (or rather indeed Nine) Kings of their own: that is, until they alſo in their turn were conquer'd by the <hi>Clanna Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadh</hi> about Thirteen hundred years before the Birth of Chriſt. 2.

Tho in all contingencies, it muſt be alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, that wherever <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> has delivered any thing to the advantage, renown, or credit of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, his teſtimony is doubtleſs above all exception for ſo much. For the confeſſion of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary is valid in all Tribunals: and both <hi>Bodin</hi> and Reaſon requires it ſhould be ſo in Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſufficiently inform'd you both of <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> and the true original grounds of the Quarrel of <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> to him: I return to the finiſhing my account of <hi>Lucius</hi> himſelf. And this I ſhall diſpatch by a little farther addition, firſt of thoſe more ſpecial conſiderations that put him on writing his <hi>Cambrenſis Everſus,</hi> and then of his performance therein. Thoſe himſelf gives at large; but I ſhall contract 'em. 1. He had often conſider'd, that altho ſoon after the coming out of <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> from the Preſs, two
<pb facs="tcp:102628:22"/> Learned <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>Richard White</hi> a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, and <hi>Philip O Suillevan</hi> a Soldier, to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the World, and right their injur'd Nation, had moſt exactly and convincingly written, each of them at large, againſt his impoſtures; yet through ill fortune their ſeveral Books on that ſubject were loſt, and no body ſince had put Pen to paper to retrive this loſs. 2. By daily converſation among Foreigners, he had found, That becauſe in ſo many years ſince that <hi>Francford</hi> Edition of <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd againſt him in Print, his very vileſt Relations of <hi>Ireland</hi> were taken for confeſſedly true. 3. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read a great number of Books, and he thinks all whatſoever written of that Kingdom by <hi>Engliſh</hi> &amp; other <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Authors; and obſerving how as many of 'em at leaſt as came out ſince the change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, were ſo unjuſt to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all there was not ſo much as any one Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, who does not either report Fictions, or conceal Truths, or exaggerate the bad, or extenuate the good Things of that People: he conſidered at laſt, that <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis</hi> was their firſt pattern. 4. And which to him was more grievous yet, he conſidered, that ever ſince the aforeſaid <hi>German</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, there was not a Book written, nor a <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mographical</hi> or <hi>Geographical</hi> Table drawn, there was not (I mean) a Map, or a Card (as they are call'd) deſcribing the cuſtoms or manners of Nations come forth in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> which was not repleniſh'd with ugly baſe reflections on the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> In ſo much, that
<pb facs="tcp:102628:22"/> in all Countreys and Languages they were on all occaſions become a Fable to the Vulgar, and object of ſcorn to others.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the conſiderations that prevail'd with <hi>Lucius</hi> to exert his zeal for Truth and Love to his Countrey, in taking all the foreſaid Books of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brenſis</hi> to pieces; laying open the moſt material of his Errors and Calumnies; (for it had been endleſs to purſue him in the more immaterial) convincing him every where; and therefore, when he had finiſh'd his Work, publiſhing it for the ſatisfaction of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Cambrenſis E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus,</hi> which may be Engliſh'd The <hi>Cambrian o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown.</hi> How juſtly it deſerves this name, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may judg, ſeeing the Book is extant, and has been ſince the year 1622. when it was printed. For my own part, I can do no leſs than acknowledg what I think of it my ſelf: which is, That the Author ſhews himſelf very converſant in thoſe Letters we call <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite.</hi> That above all, for knowledg in Hiſtory both Domeſtic &amp; Forein, Sacred and Profane, he appears excellently well qualified to write on the Subject he undertook. That every where, and whatever mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is treated, he is very exact in quoting his Authors: and where the allegation muſt depend on <hi>Iriſh</hi> Books or Writers, he never omits to give 'em by name in the Margin: among which are the <hi>Annals of Inis Fail,</hi> the <hi>Common Annals,</hi> the <hi>Annals of Anonimus, the Annals of Tigernacus,</hi> the <hi>Continuer of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernacus,</hi> the <hi>Books of Reigns, O Duuegan,
<pb facs="tcp:102628:23"/> O Donel, Colgan, Philip O Suillevan, Peter Lombard Archb. of Ardmagh, Keting, Primat Uſher,</hi> Sir <hi>James Ware.</hi> That in a word, his performances in this Book againſt <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> are accurate, abſolute, full: and therefore not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Dedication they bear prefix'd to the Sacred Majeſty of <hi>Charles II.</hi> of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King. I ſay <hi>againſt Cambrenſis.</hi> Becauſe I do abſtract wholly from his occaſional or incidental Reflections any where on the State of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince the Year 1640. To deliver my thoughts of them, is no part of my buſineſs here. What more, concerning <hi>Lucius,</hi> muſt be directly to the purpoſe of this place, is to let you underſtand, that although <hi>Cambrenſis Everſus</hi> be not a Hiſtory of <hi>Ireland:</hi> yet becauſe it is in many places fraught with choice Collections out of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Antiquities: and in the <hi>VIII.</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſionally gives, together with a Catalogue of all the Monarchs of <hi>Ireland</hi> under the ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, even from <hi>Slanius</hi> the firſt of them, a brief account of their Reigns, and Years of the World, or Chriſt reſpectively, when each King began &amp; finiſh'd his Reign: therefore, next to <hi>Keting,</hi> I have made the greateſt uſe of him, in the <hi>Former Part;</hi> tho no where before, <hi>page</hi> 130. for till I came ſo far I had him not. And out of him particularly it is, That in ſome places I add to ſuch or ſuch Monarchs the Year of the World, or of our Saviour Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation. Now what Computation is follow'd by him, in giving the former Years, I mean thoſe of
<pb facs="tcp:102628:23"/> the World, albeit he does not himſelf expreſly inform us, we may notwithſtanding moſt certainly know by his fixing the Birth of Chriſt in the Year of the World 5199. as he does in his Reign of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarch <hi>Criomthan Niadhnair</hi> (whom he calls in Latin <hi>Criomthanius Niadhnarius.</hi>) Whereby 'tis evident, he follows the computation of <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> holding therein with the generality of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chronologers, and conſequently differing in ſo much from <hi>Keting:</hi> as he does alſo differ from him, and hold with the ſame generality, as to the length of Reign or Life attributed to the two Monarchs <hi>Cobh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thach Caolbhreag, Siorna Saoghallach,</hi> &amp; ſome others. In other matters treated by him in his <hi>Cambrenſis Everſus,</hi> he ſeldom varies from <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> otherwiſe than by addition of more particulars. So you have at laſt my whole Account, and I hope a ſufficient one of theſe two Authors, whom I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg to have been my only <hi>chief</hi> Directors, for what concerns thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Affairs, treated of in the <hi>Former Part</hi> of this <hi>Proſpect.</hi> I ſay <hi>my only chief Directors,</hi> &amp;c. For,</p>
            <p>I am to inform you now a little farther, That as to other matters, and ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> too, whether pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely or occaſionally diſcours'd, I have not ſeldom in the ſame <hi>Former Part,</hi> eſpecially in the <hi>V.</hi> and <hi>VI.</hi> Section, made uſe of my own reading and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections out of other Authors, ſome Ancient, &amp; ſome Modern. As for example, out of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Hiſtory Writers, and Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:102628:24"/> 
               <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> and <hi>Polychronicon,</hi> I have borrow'd ſome things: out of <hi>Roderic</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Virgil, Harpsfield, Bodin, William Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and <hi>Buchanan,</hi> other: out of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> the far greater part of my whole diſcourſe of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias:</hi> out of a <hi>French</hi> Anonimous Author in <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Ware</hi>'s Book <hi>de Praeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus Hiberniae,</hi> what I write of <hi>Lauraſe O Tua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thail,</hi> otherwiſe called (in <hi>Latin) Laurentius Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinienſis:</hi> out of <hi>Rabanus, Jonas Abbas, Ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus Vitalis Angligena, Notkerus</hi> and <hi>Sponda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> thoſe matters you find related by me of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbanus, Gallus;</hi> and their Aſſociats: beſides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other things out of other Authors. And theſe and thoſe are commonly quoted where I make uſe of them: although ſometimes they are not becauſe both Margins being ſo narrow, and Pages ſo little; as you ſee they are, I thought it unfitting to croud them with quotations.</p>
            <p>From the Learned <hi>Cambden</hi> I ſeldom recede, tho almoſt as ſeldom made uſe of by me in the ſame <hi>Former Part.</hi> But the acknowledg'd either purity, or elegancy of <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s ſtyle makes me no admirer of his skill in the Antiquities of that Nation he writes of. Much leſs can I eſteem <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> in his writing at random of thoſe matters what he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had but from errant Impoſtors, or certainly him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had forg'd. And this (without queſtion) even contrary to what he had found written by that <hi>Iriſh</hi> great Furtherer of his, whoſe name was <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
<pb facs="tcp:102628:24"/> Hiſtoricus,</hi> and his Work entitled <hi>Chronicon multarum rerum;</hi> I mean, if this <hi>Cornelius</hi> was indeed no leſs by education in the Countrey, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in the Language than by birth an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man, and withal ſo learned as <hi>D. Hanmer,</hi> page 193. (out of <hi>Bale</hi> and <hi>Stanihurſt</hi>) repreſents him to have been under <hi>Henry III.</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> about the Year of Chriſt 1230. that is, about 200 years before <hi>Boethius</hi> had written his Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of <hi>Hanmer,</hi> or <hi>Campion</hi> either (though each of them entitles his own Work, <hi>The Hiſtory of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> nay each of 'em ventures on deducing his Narration from almoſt the very beginning of times after the Flood.) I ſcarce make mention, but, once or twice where the Subject or leads or forces me to oppoſe their great miſtakes. Which certainly are very numerous in both, eſpecially in <hi>Hanmers</hi> Work, as this is by much the larger of the two; <hi>Campion</hi>'s being only a little extemporary Piece, written by him in ten Weeks time, as himſelf confeſſes in his Dedication thereof <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>27 May 1571.</hi> To this year <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plon</hi> brought his <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> But <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> deduc'd his <hi>Chronicle</hi> (for ſo he calls it) no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to the year 1286. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he intended to bring it to his own time, had he not been prevented by death, which ſeiz'd him at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where he died of the Plague, <hi>Anno 1064.</hi>
               </note> to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> Nor muſt we much wonder, it ſhould be either ſo brief, or ſo faulty: ſeeing we have his own, farther acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment in his Preface to the <hi>Reader,</hi> That he had never ſo
<pb facs="tcp:102628:25"/> much as ſeen any of thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Books that treat of matters that happen'd before the <hi>Engliſh Conqueſt,</hi> much leſs could have any perſon to interpret them. A greater cauſe of admiration, <hi>Doctor Meredith Hanmer</hi> has given us by making his <hi>Chronicle</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo large, and yet giving every whit as little of the true Antiquities of <hi>Ireland</hi> for thoſe times preceding the ſame <hi>Engliſh Conqueſt</hi> as <hi>Campion</hi> before him had, e'en a few ſcraps out of <hi>Cambren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;</hi> but many more additional meer ſtories from himſelf, where-ever he had 'em. Among which ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries however, I do not rank his pious Relations of ſeveral <hi>Iriſh Saints,</hi> which take up above 20 leaves of his <hi>Chronicle.</hi> That is, from <hi>p. 33.</hi> to <hi>p. 104.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for <hi>Edmund Spencer,</hi> in his <hi>Dialogue</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>between <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> (bound up in the ſame Volume, as it was at firſt publiſh'd in print together with the two former Books of <hi>Campion</hi> and <hi>Hanmer</hi> at <hi>Dublin,</hi> an. 1635. by Sir <hi>James Ware,</hi>) I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

And therefore I will ſay no more of <hi>Spencer,</hi> than that although in writing his <hi>Faerie</hi> Queen he had the right of a Poet to fancy any thing; nevertheleſs, in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical part of his Dialogue (written by him, <hi>anno 1599.</hi>) he ſhould have follow'd other Rules. I ſay <hi>Hiſtorical part,</hi> &amp;c. For I am willing to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that where he purſued the <hi>Political</hi> main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this Dialogue, which was to preſcribe the ways and means to reduce <hi>Ireland</hi> (a deſign well becoming him as being Secretary to <hi>Arthur</hi> Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wilton</hi> and Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> under Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) none could ſurpaſs him: no man could except againſt him, ſave only thoſe that would not be reduc'd. But I digreſs again. For my purpoſe here in mentioning <hi>Spencer,</hi> ſhould only have been to tell you, that in all my <hi>Former Part</hi> I quote him but once. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which if I add in the laſt place, what I had almoſt forgotten, That I have more than once or twice either, quoted <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> himſelf: I hope no man will be ſcandalized that conſiders, beſides the occaſion, what uſe I make of him. Nay I do perſuade my ſelf, That to ſee <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>And now, That I gave given what I would ſay (in this Place) concerning any of thoſe other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, whom beſides <hi>Keting</hi> and <hi>Lucius,</hi> I either follow, or examine, or e'en utterly reject in the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Part</hi> of my <hi>Proſpect:</hi> there remains but little more to be Prefac'd to it. For to the <hi>Latter Part</hi> I ſhall therefore prefix an other <hi>Preface;</hi> but one by ſo much the ſhorter, by how much it muſt be proper to that <hi>Part</hi> alone. In which other Preface I mean to obſerve the ſame Method I have in this; by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an account of the Writers, who ſhall direct me in that <hi>Later Part:</hi> and how, and the reaſons why I muſt therein be guided partly by ſome of thoſe very men, whoſe teſtimonials in other matters, I ſlight in the <hi>Former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What more I would give for Preface here to the ſame <hi>Former Part</hi> only, are theſe Particulars. 1. That whereſoever I annex to any of thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchs, treated of by me, Capital or other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Figures of Numbers, whereby I would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie what rank they held<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their Catalogue; for example, whether of the Tenth, or Twentieth, or ſo forth: there I related only to the Catalogue of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſian</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102628:26"/> Monarchs; not to any other containing both <hi>Mileſian,</hi> and the other 18. Monarchs of the ſeveral Conqueſts that preceded theirs. 2. That although I have endeavoured with all diligence to extract in order thoſe <hi>Mileſian</hi> Monarchs out of <hi>Ketings</hi> vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous Hiſtory, which no where adds to any of 'em the number, <hi>i. e.</hi> any ſuch Letters, Figures, or Words importing it: after all I cannot be ſure I have not miſtaken, and this perhaps more than once, in adding my numbers. But the beſt on't is, that the errour, if any ſuch be, is not material. 3. That where I ſpeak of 2988 years, or ſometimes of a year, or a few years more or leſs from the firſt of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Conqueſt: in all ſuch places I follow the Account of <hi>Keting.</hi> Who to reduce the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chronology to an agreement not only with his own Computation of the years of the World, but with the Relation alſo of <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> and <hi>Polychro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicon</hi> (where they tell us, of the <hi>Mileſians</hi> having conquer'd that Kingdom 1800 years before S. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric</hi>'s death) purpoſely cut off of the Reigns of ſeveral of their Kings, ſo many years as make in all 491. But elſewhere, that is, <hi>p. 496, &amp;c.</hi> and in the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> I have ſtrictly follow'd <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> (and conſequently the <hi>Iriſh Book of Reigns</hi>) as to the number of years the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Kings reigned, or Kingdom laſted. 4. That for want of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Books or Antiquaries to conſult with, I confeſs it remains a difficulty with me ſtill, How the ſix Sons of the <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> K. <hi>Muredus,</hi> as <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> calls him in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> who in <hi>Iriſh</hi> is call'd <hi>Muiridhach</hi> by <hi>Keting,</hi>

That if any where in theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of <hi>Ireland</hi> you meet with ſome Relations ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Miracles above Nature, or Antiquities hard to believe: I muſt beg that you will notwithſtanding be ſo juſt as at leaſt to believe, I have no deſign to impoſe either upon your reaſon or upon your free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 6. That beſides, it will be no more than Juſtice requires of you, to perſuade your ſelf, That no Relatour of matters ſo far beyond our ken is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for his own belief or disbelief of them, much leſs for their objective truth or untruth (<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or not <hi>being</hi>) in themſelves. Provided he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates no impoſſibilities, nor abſurdities, nor contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of all other Hiſtories that are eſteemed true; nor any thing whatſoever out of other Records than Authentick, or other Authors than Claſſick, or at leaſt other than ſuch as have been among their own People reputed men of Probity and Reaſon, and acknowledg'd ſo in ſuch matters as they write of. 7. That I have commonly choſen to give the
<pb facs="tcp:102628:27"/> 
               <hi>Iriſh</hi> proper Names and Surnames, though not in <hi>Iriſh</hi> Characters, yet in ſuch <hi>Italick</hi> Letters as anſwer them: becauſe by having them ſo, the Reader may be much better aſſured, that he ſees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the true genuine names, whether he can pronounce them rightly, or not, than he could be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if according to the cuſtom of others, I had transform'd 'em into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> either ſyllables or terminations. And yet withal, my Copy of <hi>Keting</hi> being very bad in many places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which I do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly acknowledg my own skill to correct the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Orthography of it very ſmall: I muſt in reaſon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect my performance in this matter. But neither can the Errours herein be either material or any way conſiderable. 8. That I confeſs I have taken a quite contrary courſe to the late <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Writers, in magnifying, ſo far as good Authority did war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant me, the <hi>Ancient Iriſh</hi> Nation: which they, a man would think, made it their buſineſs to leſſen and vilifie all they could. But nevertheleſs, I doubt not, all judicious impartial men will acknowledg; how much more it muſt redound to the honour of the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> to have conquered an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, civil, warlike, brave People in the days of Yore, than ſuch an obſcure, barbarous, vile, hideous generation of men as partly the <hi>Cambrian Author,</hi> partly others that follow'd the pattern left by him repreſent thoſe <hi>Old</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland</hi> in their time. Beſides, if without any relation to others, but on the naked ſole contemplation of ſome excellencies
<pb facs="tcp:102628:28"/> in that ancient People I have ſuffer'd ſome tranſport, who can blame me? None, I believe, that conſiders attentively the import and conſequence of this Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Roman Sage,</hi> though delivered by him on an other ſubject. <hi>Some acts of Liberality, ſome of Humanity, ſome of Fortitude had aſtoniſh'd us: and we began to admire them as perfect, Under 'em lay many vices, which the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance &amp; ſplendor of ſome conſpicuous Fact did conceal: and theſe we diſſembled. Nature bids us magnifie deeds that are commendable. None but has extol'd the glorious beyond truth.</hi> So ſaid <hi>Lucius Annaeus Seneca</hi> (in his one Hundred and Twentieth Epiſtle) as rigid a <hi>Stoick</hi> as he was. And yet I can ſay for my ſelf this much, that I have been ſo far from diſſembling in any ſuch kind, where I had unqueſtionable Authors to lead me, that I rather fear to have exceeded on this ſide, than on that other. 9. That when I had almoſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd this <hi>Former Part,</hi> I was unexpectedly deſir'd to print before it a Catalogue (tho containing only the bare Names) of all the Kings that in the ſucceſſion of ſo many Conqueſts, and many more Ages, for even 3204 years reign'd from <hi>Slanius</hi> the Son of <hi>Dela</hi> to the ſixth year of <hi>Rotheric O Connor</hi> the Laſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Race, when <hi>Hen. II.</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was receiv'd Lord of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the year of Chriſt 1172. And though I had my ſelf no inclination to it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, that ſince I have not given any kind of Hiſtory, great or ſmall, of all their Lives or Reigns,
<pb facs="tcp:102628:28"/> nor indeed any particular account in any Method<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hiſtorical or not Hiſtorical, no not ſcarce of the Tenth among 'em: it would ſeem a vanity in me to promiſe more by the Frontiſpiece than the whole Structure is worth: yet after I was perſuaded. So prevalent with me was the eſteem I had of his judgment that urg'd it: altho he gave me no other reaſon, than that certainly it would prove at leaſt ſome ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all curious Searchers into ſuch remote pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of Antiquity. And truly had he or any other given me this occaſion before I had engag'd too far in purſuance of the Method taken by me all along: I would have given another kind of Catalogue. I mean ſuch a one as, together with the Name of each King, ſhould have had annex'd the years of his Reign, the means of his attaining the Sovoreignty, the manner of his death, whether natural or violent, ſome one at leaſt of his moſt remarkable Kingly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if any ſuch were recorded of him, the Year of the World or Chriſt reſpectively, anſwering both the firſt and laſt of his Reign: and all this of each in a ſmall number of Lines: and the whole of all in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight ſheets, at moſt, or thereabouts. I am ſure I might with far leſs trouble have done it, than the collecting, digeſting, and diſcourſing on the matters handled in any one, at leaſt in the ſixth Section of this <hi>Former Part,</hi> have given me. <hi>Gratianus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> in his <hi>Eighth Chapter,</hi> would have eas'd me of other care in doing it, than that of rendring his Catalogue there into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> &amp; in ſome few places
<pb facs="tcp:102628:29"/> abridging him, by referring the Reader to thoſe <hi>pages</hi> of my own where I treat the matter at large; and in very few places more, by adding ſomewhat out of <hi>Keting,</hi> and then animadverting on both <hi>Keting</hi> and him. But no eaſing me in that kind could hinder the unproportionable ſwelling of this <hi>Former Part,</hi> if I ſhould annex to it ſuch a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue as this. And therefore in ſtead thereof I give that of bare Names, which take up but little room. Perhaps hereafter I may give the other too in a ſmall Treatiſe bound together with the <hi>Later Part.</hi> I mean, if that <hi>Later Part</hi> can better than this here admit of ſuch a conjunction, without rendring it ſelf unproportionably thick. However that happen, there needs no further Preface now.</p>

               <head>Some Obſervations on, and Inferences from this Catalogue.</head>
               <p>TO underſtand this Catalogue (which I have drawn with all the care and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I could, out of <hi>Ketings</hi> Hiſtory at large, and <hi>Gratianus Lucius's</hi> VIII. Chapter of his <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brenſis Everſus</hi>) be pleas'd to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Surnames</hi> of ſuch Kings as had any, are given here, in a different Character from that of their firſt and <hi>proper Names.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:102628:33"/>2. That to all Kings of the ſame <hi>Proper Name,</hi> who had no <hi>Surname</hi> (I mean any other ſecond Name, derived from ſome peculiar qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mind, or Body, or Fortune, as all their Surnames were,) I have likewiſe for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction's ſake, in a different Character (beſides Figures ſignifying what place each of 'em held among the reſt, for Example, whither the Firſt, or Second, or ſo forth among thoſe of the ſame Name) I have I ſay added their Fathers Name alſo, with the word <hi>Mac</hi> (which im ports a Son) before 'em.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Marginal or Firſt Figures in the head of the Lines, rather ſignifie the order of Succeſſion, than the number of Kings: becauſe many of the Lines have two, one of 'em three, and an other four Kings, ruling together in a joint Sovereignty, at leaſt for ſome time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That although both <hi>Keting</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> concur in telling us how the four Brothers of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Conqueſt (numb. 5.) <hi>Ear, Orba, Fearon,</hi> and <hi>Feargna,</hi> ſons to <hi>Eibhir</hi> Fionn (we call him <hi>Heber</hi>) had in the Third year of the former joint Sovereignty of the Three ſons of <hi>Erimhon,</hi> (after the death of the Firſt of theſe Three) kill'd in Battel the two ſurviving Kings <hi>Luighne</hi> and <hi>Laighne;</hi> yet <hi>Lucius</hi> only (not <hi>Keting</hi>) has rank'd 'em in the Catalogue of Kings; who notwithſtanding confeſſes, their Reign was but Three months in all, when their
<pb facs="tcp:102628:33"/> own Coſin German <hi>Iriall Faidh</hi> (the fourth and youngeſt ſon of <hi>Erimhon</hi>) gave them Battel at <hi>Cuile-Mertha,</hi> vanquiſh'd and kill'd 'em all four in that Field.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That neither <hi>Buchadh</hi> (N. 62.) tho told us by <hi>Keting</hi> to have been the Man that kil'd the Monarch <hi>Eoghun Mor,</hi> is counted by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Kings, as who had had the Sovereign Power only 36 hours, or a day and a half in all. But <hi>Lucius</hi> nevertheleſs inſerts him as one of 'em: adding however to his memory this <hi>Motto</hi> of the Poet, <hi>

               <p n="9">9.

               <p>And now that for your better and eaſier un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this Catalogue you have the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Obſervations: I'll only add one more; which tho unn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ceſſary for that end, may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding give you cauſe enough towonder, by conſidering the general Fate of about Nine Parts of Ten of ſo many Sovereign Princes as you ſee in this whole Catalogue, from <hi>Slainghe,</hi> the Firſt of the <hi>Fir-bholgian,</hi> to <hi>Ruaridh,</hi> the Laſt of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Conqueſt. For I can aſſure you
<pb facs="tcp:102628:34"/> here, that after the greateſt diligence I could uſe to ſatisfie my ſelf by taking Notes out of <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> both, I find That of ſo vaſt a number of <hi>Mileſian</hi> Kings, not above ſix and twenty in all had other then violent ends. Which is three leſs than what I have elſwhere inſinuated the number of ſuch of them as had natural ends to have been. As for the <hi>Fir-bhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> &amp; <hi>Tuath-De-Danann</hi> Kings, tho proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably fewer e'en of either died violent deaths; yet of their 18. which was their whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, fourteen loſt their Lives by the Sword.</p>
               <p>But how many, or how few ſoever you pleaſe, of all theſe and thoſe Kings of all the Former Conqueſts ended their days either by the hands of other men, or ſome prodigious judgment of Heaven, or means of other extrinſick ſecondary Cauſes, in ſuch manner as rendred their deaths properly violent: the Inferences out of this Catalogue are plain.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if we count ſeverally each of thoſe <hi>Mileſian</hi> Princes, who jointly, or in Aſſociation with any other, govern'd as Kings of <hi>Ireland:</hi> and withal not count the ſame Perſon twice; nor count among 'em either <hi>Cairbre</hi> I. ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Ccann-cheit,</hi> or <hi>Feilim</hi> I. mhac Conruidh (ſee Numb. 98. &amp; 99.) as indeed we ought not, being theſe Two are the only noted for meer Uſurpers, becauſe both were choſen, one after another, by the <hi>Plebeians</hi> only, nay and only too to head their moſt hideous bloody Rebellion of
<pb facs="tcp:102628:35"/> 25 years continuance, againſt all the <hi>Royal Line</hi> (and as for the former of 'em, <hi>viz.

               <p>Much leſs was there ever in any Chronicle or Book that I could ſee, either in <hi>Engliſh, Iriſh,</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> before <hi>Cambden's Britannia</hi> came forth, any mention made of <hi>Edgar</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> how puiſſant ſoever he was, his having conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a great part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Dublin</hi> withal, or indeed ſo much as one foot of Land there, nay or ſo much as his having attempted any ſuch thing.

               <p>And ſo I do as little of <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s relation, where he writes, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, King of <hi>Scotland</hi> (who began his Reign <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 875. and ended it with his life <hi>Anno</hi> 902.) invaded <hi>Ireland</hi> with a puiſſant Army,

               </p>
               <p>Certainly <hi>Ireland</hi> never had at any time, ſince the very beginning (not even ſince the firſt Monarch <hi>Slanius,</hi> who reigned above three thouſand years ago) any King that was a Minor, as Doctor <hi>Keting</hi> well obſerves, and may be ſeen by any that reads over in his Chronology and Hiſtory all the Reigns of the ſeveral Monarchs, who during that vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of time ſucceſſively govern'd <hi>Ireland,</hi> or had the Title to govern as Monarchs there, until it came under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Power in the year of Chriſt 1172.

The difference only was, that the former continued forty years, or thereabouts; but this War now off and on a hundred and fifty years compleat. And when the former began, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had no ſtrangers in pay whoſe Revolt might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger them: but when this began they had
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102628:49"/> a great number even of <hi>Daniſh,</hi> or other Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterling Foreigners (whom immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ending the former War, they entertain'd in pay, and therefore call'd 'em <hi>Bownies</hi>) to guard their Coaſts all round the Kingdom, and theſe every one turned againſt them now. Beſides in the former the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were all of a mind againſt the common Enemy; but in this they were often divided, ſome of them confederating openly and fighting in conjunction with thoſe forein Enemies againſt their Native Soil, eſpecially the little King of <hi>Deſies</hi> in <hi>Mounſter,</hi> and the King of <hi>Leinſter</hi> too not ſeldom.

               <p>But that I may at laſt come to an iſſue on this point, I will paſs over all thoſe Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Battels fought by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure of this ſecond <hi>Daniſh</hi> War made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102628:49"/> mhic Floinn,</hi> fought by <hi>Ceallaghane</hi> King of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> whereby he not only took <hi>Limme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, Caſhel, Cork,</hi> and <hi>Waterford</hi> from the <hi>Danes,</hi> but quite extirpated them at leaſt in his days out of that Province. His Sea-fight alſo with their Fleet before <hi>Dundalk;</hi> which proved extreamly fatal to them. Likewiſe the great ſlaughter of their fellows in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught</hi> by the <hi>Conacians</hi> about the ſame time. Moreover, and which was ſomewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and before <hi>Ceallaghane</hi> had taken <hi>Limmerick,</hi> the Battel of <hi>Roſcrea,</hi> where the Merchants and Townſmen at a great <hi>Fair</hi> held in that place on Saint <hi>Peters</hi> day, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of an Army of <hi>Danes</hi> coming on them from <hi>Connaught</hi> and <hi>Limmerick</hi> under a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Earl called <hi>Oilſin,</hi> ſet forth againſt them in the beſt order they could, fought them, defeated them, and kill'd three or four thouſand of them in that Field.

And further yet, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat given to <hi>Rodoricus</hi> the King of <hi>Britains</hi> Son, who <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 966. as <hi>Hanmer</hi> ſays, invaded <hi>Ireland</hi> with a puiſſant Army, but loſt both Army and Life by thoſe he invaded. 4. The Battel of <hi>Muine Broghaine</hi> fought by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102628:50"/> the Monarch <hi>Conghallach mhac Maoil Mhithe,</hi> with the ſlaughter of 7000 <hi>Danes</hi> on the ſpot, though with great loſs of his own ſide too. 5. and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even all thoſe four &amp; twenty bloudy Battels fought againſt the <hi>Danes,</hi> and their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats before the Battel of <hi>Cluain-Tairbh,</hi> and fought I ſay every one of them by that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py victorious Prince until his death <hi>Brien mhac Kinedie,</hi> alias <hi>Boraimhe,</hi> who in the fourth year of the foreſaid Monarch <hi>Conghallach</hi>'s Reign came to be King of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> and within eight years next following made all <hi>Leath Mogha,</hi> i. e. the Southern half of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> acknowledg him their Sovereign: and ruled ſo for ſeven and thirty years, until he was choſen at laſt Monarch of all <hi>Ireland:</hi> in which laſt Supremacy he continued flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remainder of his life, which after twelve years more he ended victoriouſly at <hi>Cluain-tairf</hi> Field. And as I do paſs over ſo many former Battels wherein the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were victorious in this ſecond War: ſo I ſhall thoſe many other too wherein they were to ſome purpoſe foiled in the ſame War; tho Martial courage, tho true Valour may ſometimes exert it ſelf no leſs in the Foil than in the Victory. I'le take no notice, neither of the ſtoning to death <hi>Maolguala,</hi> King of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> by thoſe barbarous heathen Foes, in the Reign of <hi>Aodh Finliath:</hi> nor of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102628:50"/> the mighty overthrow given the <hi>Leinſter</hi> men by <hi>Jomhar</hi> one of their Generals, in the reign of <hi>Niall Gluindubh:</hi> nor of <hi>Sitric,</hi> another General of theirs, both defeating and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and that in a more conſiderable fight alſo, the ſaid Monarch <hi>Niall Gluindubb</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: nor of the Battel of <hi>Biothlane</hi> againſt the <hi>Leinſter</hi> men again, under the Reign of <hi>Domhnal mhac Muirchirtae:</hi> nor finally of the Battel of <hi>Cille mhoane,</hi> fought by the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Lagenians</hi> both, joyn'd together now againſt their Monarch <hi>Domhnal mhac Muirchirtae;</hi> wherein the King of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter Ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> and <hi>Dombnal</hi> King of <hi>Oirghiellae,</hi> and many others of great quality were kill'd of the Monarch's ſide.</p>
               <p>As well every one of theſe unſucceſsful Battels, as all the former, ten times both in number and weight, more ſucceſsful to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the ſecond War, I willingly paſs over, to come unto, and give you the famous Fight of <hi>Cluain-Tairbh</hi> at laſt. It was the five and twentieth and laſt of all the Battels fought ſo bravely by that victorious King of <hi>Ireland, Brian Boraimhe</hi> himſelf. It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Battel that put an end to all the <hi>Daniſh,</hi> hopes in that Kingdom. Beſides, it was, if ever any was, by mutual conſent of both ſides, a pitch'd Battel, and the Field, whereon it was fought, ſome weeks before
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102628:51"/> agreed upon between them. So that there was no place at all for Ambuſcadoes, Tricks, or ſtratagems in it; but pure Valour muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the quarrel and win the day.</p>
               <p>The occaſion, manner and iſſue of it, take thus in ſhort. About the end of <hi>Brian Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raimh</hi>'s Reign, the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> being all over in peace and flouriſhing with all earthly bleſſings under him, and no more <hi>Danes</hi> left in the Land, but ſuch a certain number of Artificers, Handy-craftſmen, and Merchants in <hi>Dublin, Weixford, Waterford, Cork,</hi> and <hi>Limmerick,</hi> as he thought and knew could be maſter'd at any time if they dared rebel: he ſends to his Brother-in-law <hi>Maolmoradh mhac Murchoe</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> deſiring three ſpecial Maſts for ſhipping out of his Woods. <hi>Maoldmoradh</hi> conſents, and goes himſelf to ſee them drawn along by the ſtreingth of men to <hi>Cean Choradh,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's Houſe in <hi>Tomond.</hi> A difference hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in the way between thoſe men, and thereupon <hi>Maolmoradh</hi> alighting, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to draw one of the beams up a high Mountain which they muſt have croſs'd, he toare off the claſp of his outward Robe. Which, ſo ſoon as he came to the Monarchs Court, and viſited the Queen, his own Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Garmlaigh,</hi> he deſires her to faſten, telling her how it was torn off. She
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102628:51"/> takes the Robe, throws it into the fire, burns it before his face, and then rebukes him ſmartly for his unworthy ſubjection of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his people of <hi>Leinſter</hi> to <hi>Briean,</hi> though her Husband. And the Monarch <hi>Maolmoradh</hi> taking to heart her words, and turning aſide to ſee <hi>Murchoe</hi> the Prince, <hi>Brian</hi>'s eldeſt Son, playing a game at Cheſs, adviſes againſt him on ſome draught, whereby the Prince loſt his game. Who thereupon fretting and twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Uncle this <hi>Leinſter</hi> King; told him, that his advice formerly given to the <hi>Danes</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Gleann Mama</hi> loſt them the Field. <hi>Maolmoradh</hi> replyes, that his next ſhould prove otherwiſe. The Prince defies him. <hi>Maolmoradh</hi> withdraws, goes to bed Supperleſs, and early in the morning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known poſts away to <hi>Leinſter.</hi> Where the very next day after his coming, he aſſembles his chief Noblemen, repreſents to them what had paſt, ſets them all on fire to renounce their Allegiance to <hi>Briean,</hi> confederate with the <hi>Danes,</hi> and ſend the Monarch defiance. Then he poſts immediatly to <hi>Dublin,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages the chief of the <hi>Danes</hi> there to ſend forthwith to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> for a ſtrong ſupply to help him againſt their mortal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy <hi>Brian Boraimhe,</hi> and promiſes them his deſtruction. And then he prepares at home for War. And then within a little more time
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102628:52"/> having ſeen twelve thouſand men under the command of two of the King of <hi>Denmark's</hi> Sons, <hi>Carolus Knutus,</hi> and <hi>Andreas,</hi> landed ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and both kindly received them, and refreſhed them very well; he without longer delay by a Herauld bid defiance to <hi>Brian,</hi> and challenges him to fight on <hi>Magh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealta</hi> a ſpacious Field at <hi>Cluain-Tairbh</hi> (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe <hi>Clantarf)</hi> within two miles of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi> And <hi>Brian,</hi> with what ſpeed he can, joyning together all the Forces of <hi>Mounſter, Connaght,</hi> and <hi>Meath</hi> (for thoſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> he neither ſent unto, nor would ſtay for, as confiding mightily in thoſe he had already out of the three other Diviſions, and haſtning to fight) marches directly to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>Maghnealta,</hi> and ſees the Enemy there, prepared to receive him, <hi>viz.</hi> ſixteen thouſand <hi>Danes,</hi> twelve of the new, and four of the old ones, together with all the power of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> headed by their ſaid King <hi>Maol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moradh</hi> the only Author of this Battel. To be ſhort, both Armies drawing near, and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully one another, the fatal ſign is given at laſt, and Trumpets ſound and skies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound with the terrible ſhouts of both ſides, as they cloſed. But <hi>Maolſeachluin</hi> the King of <hi>Meath,</hi> who had been Monarch before <hi>Brian Boraimhe,</hi> and was depoſed to give him place (the only Monarch of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102628:52"/> from the beginning did ſurvive his depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) finding it now his time to be in ſome ſort revenged on <hi>Brian,</hi> ſtands off with his Forces of <hi>Meath</hi> ſo ſoon as the ſignal was given, and continues a meer Spectator du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time of the Battel, without joyning with either ſide. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this treacherous carriage of <hi>Maolſeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luin,</hi> (for it can be term'd no better, though after this Fight was over, he recovered the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy by it, and was the laſt Monarch of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Race obeyed or acknowledged as ſuch univerſally throughout the Kingdom) yet I ſay, notwithſtanding it, the valorous undaunted Prince <hi>Murchoe,</hi> eldeſt Son of <hi>Brian Boraimhe,</hi> having perſuaded his Father to retire into his Tent by reaſon of his great age (for he was now fourſcore and eight years old) behaved himſelf with his <hi>Momo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> and <hi>Conacian</hi> Forces ſo bravely, and made ſuch and ſo many furious impreſſions on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide into the main Battalions of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that although neither courage, nor dexterity, nor ambition, nor glory, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, nor deſpair, propoſed unto them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, were wanting to make the <hi>Daniſh</hi> and <hi>Lagenian</hi> Forces withſtand him a very long time, and ſell the Victory at a very dear rate; he won the Field at laſt, or rather indeed his Father and his Army won it after
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102628:53"/> his death. For this renowned Prince was kill'd in the Battel. And, which is far more ſtrange, the Father himſelf <hi>Brian Boraimhe</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, now after the Field had been clearly gain'd, and the remainder of the Enemy ſcattered into the four Winds, was kill'd in his own Tent by one <hi>Bruaodor</hi> a <hi>Dane,</hi> who in the general Rout leading a party after him was forc'd to fly that way where the Monarch's Tent was pitch'd. Whereinto, as he paſs'd by, entring, and ſeeing the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch whom he had formerly known, he ſlew him; though himſelf and his followers were preſently cut in pieces by thoſe that purſued them.</p>
               <p>Of the Monarchs ſide, beſides himſelf and his Son the Prince, were kill'd in this Battel, ſeven little Kings, moſt of the other Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity both of <hi>Mounſter</hi> and <hi>Connaught,</hi> and 4000 of inferiour degree. But of the other ſide were kill'd, firſt the King of <hi>Leinſter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Molmoradh mhac Murchoe</hi> (the Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Brian</hi> to this Battel) with his chief Nobles, and 3000 common Souldiers: then of the <hi>Danes,</hi> the two Sons of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> all their great Nobility, 6700 of the Souldiers newly come with them, and of the old <hi>Danes,</hi> that were before their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Ireland,</hi> 4000 more: in all of both ſides, 17000 ſeven hundred, beſides Princes

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102628:56"/> of time, eſpecially ſince the firſt <hi>Daniſh</hi> War, manyother much leſſer Kings, they had anciently three great Councils held in three ſeveral places: the Council of <hi>Taragh,</hi> the Council of <hi>Eumhna,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Gruachain:</hi> all three called in their language <hi>Feis Teambrach, Feis Eumhna,</hi> and <hi>Feis Grua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chain.</hi> The firſt was a <hi>Triennial</hi> Parliament of all the Eſtates aſſembled at <hi>Taragh</hi> in <hi>Meath,</hi> at the Monarch's pleaſure, about that time of year, which we call now <hi>All Saints.</hi> It was ordained firſt by <hi>Ollamh Fodhla</hi> the Twentieth Monarch after <hi>Herimon,</hi> to be thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth from time to time perpetually obſerv'd in after Ages. It was death, without mercy, without any hopes of it, without any power in the Monarch himſelf to extend it to any perſon whatſoever, either to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It was called only for making Laws, reforming general abuſes, reviſing their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, Genealogies, Chronicles, and either reſtoring or preſerving peace and love among 'em by feaſting together for ſeven days in one great Houſe. And therefore it is notable what Dr. <hi>Keting</hi> has in the Reign of <hi>Tuathall Teachtvair</hi> the Monarch, of the manner of their meeting and ſitting at theſe Feaſts. That the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102628:56"/> Room prepared to receive them all being made of purpoſe, tho very longs yet narrow, with Tables ſet on both ſides and both ends, and all things ready for the Entertainment: and then the Room cleared of all perſons whatſoever, only the Marſhal, the chief He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld or Chronicler, and a Horn-winder ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: and then at three convenient little diſtances of time, this Horn-winder calling to Dinner by the winding of his Horn; at the firſt of 'em, all the Eſquires or Shield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers to the Princes and Nobility came to the door, and there delivered their Shields to the Marſhal, who by the Heraulds direction hung them up in their due places over the Tables prepared of the right hand-ſide for the Eſtates. At the ſecond, in like manner all the Taget-bearers to the Generals and other great Commanders of the <hi>Militia</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up theirs, and were on the other ſide of the Houſe placed orderly as the former. But at the third, all the Kings, Princes, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, Military men, and other chief Gentry came in and fat down, each one under his own Goat of Arms blazon'd on his Shield, without any diſorder about precedency, or of places; no man ſitting on the outſide of the Table, nor any Woman at all admitted: the Table in one end being for the Antiquaries, and in the other for other Officers.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:102628:57"/>
               <p>But to paſs over this matter of Ceremony, Herauldry and Feaſting, what I chiefly note in their procedure, when they ſat in Council or Parliament, is their extraordinary care, diligence and exactneſs in providing, That all their monuments of Antiquity, their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies, Cronicles and Records ſhould have nothing foiſted into them, nothing at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, but what was true and certain by the approbation of a ſpecial Committee of the moſt skilful in ſuch matters. That all ſuch, and only ſuch National Concerns, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, or other matters, which they approv'd, after their diligent ſearch and examination of them, ſhould be there in publick written in the Kings or Monarchs book of Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords called the <hi>Pſalter of Taragh:</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was repugnant to that Book, ſhould have no credit. That, in proſecution of this great care of their National Monuments, it was, that when they became Chriſtians, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all their Eſtates both Temporal and Spiritual (held under the Monarch <hi>Laogirius</hi> at the ſame Royal Habitation of the Monarchs, <hi>Taragh</hi>) deputed three Kings, three Biſhops, and three of their moſt ſingular Antiquaries (even Saint <hi>Patrick</hi> himſelf there preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of theſe Biſhops, as the other two were <hi>Benuin</hi> and <hi>Caraioch;</hi> and the three Kings, the foreſaid <hi>Laogirius</hi> Monarch of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

That this Committee of Nine having done ſo with great pains and induſtry, they reduced all into one Book fairly written. That the keeping of this original Book, was intruſted after, by the Eſtates to the Prelats: and thoſe Prelats, for its perpetual preſervation, cauſed ſeveral authentick Copies of it to be fairly engroſs'd: whereof ſome are extant to this day, and ſeveral more faithfully tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed out of them; their Names (taken from the places where they were for many Ages kept) being the <hi>Book of Ardmach,</hi> The <hi>Pſalter of Casſhell,</hi> The <hi>Book of Gleann da Loch,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I may add, as not very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent in this place, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation were all along from the beginning ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to, and had ſo great an eſteem of the knowledg of their own Genealogies &amp; Hiſtories, that <note place="margin">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102628:58"/> them in perpetuity for attending wholly that Calling and ſtudy of it; every great Lord having a peculiar Sept of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and tranſmit to Poſterity what eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concern'd him and thoſe deriving from him; beſides what concern'd the Nation in general; yet all continually ſubject to the foreſaid Triennial Scrutiny in Parliament. A care of Antiquity and Hiſtory, I think, not to be match'd by any other Nation in <hi>Europe.</hi> And as they took that care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their Antiquaries, ſo they did alſo, as <hi>Cambden</hi>

               <p>In the two other Councils of <hi>Eumhna</hi> and <hi>Cruachain,</hi> the matters principally debated by the Nobility, Gentry, and other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them were the concerns of all the Artificers, Tradeſmen, and Handicrafts-men of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Smiths of all ſorts, Carpenters, Maſons, &amp;c. whereof a great number was ſummon'd to be at each Aſſembly. Out of which number theſe two Councils did cull out ſixty the moſt eminent in their profeſſions, and gave them authority all over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, allowing them diſtinct juriſdictions,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102628:58"/> to reform all the abuſes of their ſeveral Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and ſuſpend ſuch as they thought fit from exerciſing them. So that none could ſet up or continue any Mechanical occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but with their Licence, after they had examined and made trial of the ſufficiency or inſufficiency of the party concern'd.

               <p>So much of their Councils and Government as to Civil Affairs in the more ancient times both of Paganiſm and Chriſtianity.

               <p>But if you deſire to know the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of their Nobility, or the different Titles of Honour among thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Noblemen who ſat in their Parliaments or Councils: I can only anſwer, beſides what is ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that in <hi>Ireland</hi> until the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, they had none of our Titles, that is, not thoſe either of Duke, or Marqueſs, Earl, Viſcount, Baron, or Knight (only ſuch Knights as they called <hi>Niadha-Nask,</hi> and may
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102628:59"/> be called by us in <hi>Engliſh Knights of the Chain,</hi> or in <hi>Latin Milites Torquati,</hi> from a certain kind of Chain put about their Necks): as no more in truth had <hi>Scotland</hi> any ſuch Titles before the year of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 1074. when <hi>Malcolm</hi> III.

               <p>
                  <q>As in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Tongue became more generally ſpoken, <hi>(viz. in William the Conquerours Reign, for of that time this Author ſpeaks here)</hi> ſo in that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by reaſon of the multitude of this Nation, attending both the Queen and her Brother <hi>Edgar,</hi> and daily repairing thither for their ſafety, and combination againſt the common Enemy.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102628:59"/> remaining to this day. The Titles for diſtinguiſhing degrees of Honour, as of Duke, Earl, Baron, Rider, or Knight, were then (as is thought) firſt introduced: and the nobler ſort began to be called by the title of their <hi>Seigneuries</hi> (according to the <hi>French</hi> manner) which before bare the name of their Father, with the addition of <hi>Mac,</hi> after the faſhion of Ireland. <hi>Sam.

               <p>12. As to their conſtant ordinary <hi>Militia,</hi> what it was in their times of peace we find in the Reign of <hi>Cormock <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lfada</hi> (the Son of <hi>Airt)</hi> King of <hi>Ireland</hi> a little after the Birth of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For then it conſiſted of three Battalions or Diviſions, of equal number each, in all nine thouſand men, under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Commanders, and <hi>Fionn mhac Cuual</hi> their General; who was neither <hi>Gyant,</hi> nor <hi>Dane,</hi> nor other Foreigner, as no more were any of his Commanders, Captains or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. He was himſelf but of the ordinary ſtature of other men; though <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> makes him a <hi>Giant</hi> of 15 Cubits high: and he was an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man both by birth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent lineally come, of his Mothers ſide, in the fifth Generation, from <hi>Nuatha Neacht</hi> King
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102628:60"/> of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and ſo upward all along from <hi>Herimon;</hi> whatever is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>D. Hanmer</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Page 24.</note> to the contrary, in his Hiſtory of <hi>Ireland. Hanmer</hi> might as well have made the <hi>Cappadocian</hi> Knight a <hi>Saxon,</hi> as <hi>Fionn</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cuual,</hi> a <hi>Dane.</hi> And ſo might <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> have as well turn'd <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> or <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> or the <hi>Knight of the Sun,</hi> or the <hi>Seven Champions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi> and ſuch like Romances into the very trueſt Hiſtories, as the Fables written of <hi>Fionn mhac Cuual,</hi> and the Captains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him called <hi>Fiona Erionn,</hi> only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain leaſurable hours and Fancy. For the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had their Romances too for divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They had <hi>Bruoidhuin in Chaorhuinn,</hi> and the Battel of <hi>Fionthraghadh</hi> (or <hi>Fentra,</hi> as <hi>Hanmer</hi> calls it) and the ſtory of <hi>Gilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deackuir</hi>'s Jade, and many other ſuch, and ſo among theſe, ſome alſo of <hi>Fionn mhac Cuual</hi> and his Commanders. Which yet every one of common ſenſe among the <hi>Iriſh</hi> could diſtinguiſh from their Chronicles and other Monuments of real ſtory. In ſhort, theſe Gentlemen <hi>Fionn mhac Cuaal</hi> and <hi>Fiona E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionn</hi> were the ſtouteſt and braveſt fighting men of their time in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And they were kept in conſtant pay by the Monarch, Princes and people of that Kingdom, to guard the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102628:60"/> Coaſts from abroad, and keep all at home quiet. With power nevertheleſs, that if the caſe required it, either to ſuppreſs a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, or withſtand an Invaſion, or ſuccour <hi>Dal Riadac</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the ſaid General <hi>Fionn mhac Cuual</hi> might make up the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Forces to ſeven Battalions, that is, one and twenty thouſand men in all. And this is the naked truth concerning theſe <hi>Fiona Erionn</hi> ſo famous in their Generation. On which truth many fabulous ſtories have been ſuperſtructed.</p>
               <p>To them may be added thoſe other brave Warriors, whether of a later or earlier Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (but as to the reality of things for ought I know, of as much bravery and Valour) called <hi>Dal-Gheaſſe.</hi> Theſe were the ſtanding Militia of thoſe fortunate ſucceſsful Kings of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Ceallaghan,</hi> and <hi>Brian Boraimhe</hi> in the ſecond <hi>Daniſh</hi> War, and the only <hi>Gens d'Armes</hi> about their perſons, and continued to be ſo to the ſucceeding Kings of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> and <hi>Leathe Mogh,</hi> who were Monarchs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at leaſt bore that Title, three of them in ſucceſſion, after the death of that <hi>Maolſeachluin,</hi> who immediatly ſucceeded <hi>Brian Boraimhe.</hi> What number theſe Valiant men <hi>Dal-Gheaſſe</hi> did make, I cannot find. But ſee them all along repreſented for incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Warriors, till being over-power'd at laſt by the King of <hi>Connaght</hi> and <hi>Leathe Cuinn,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:102628:61"/> and preſumed Monarch, <hi>Torlagh More O Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> they were utterly deſtroyed a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Engliſh Conqueſt, and with them the Kingdom of <hi>Mounſter</hi> extinguiſh'd. For this by that Monarch was divided in two, and continued ſo till the Engliſh aboliſh'd them both.</p>
               <p>13. Of their Learning, Hiſtorians make no mention till after their converſion to Chriſtianity. Which Converſion, if we ſpeak of it as to the generality of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by Saint <hi>Patrick</hi> their Apoſtle, as we have ſeen before, early in the fifth Century, that is in the year 431. upon his ſecond landing in that Countrey, and compleated by him within threeſcore and one years more. For ſo long he lived carrying on that holy Work, though he had been full threeſcore and one aged upon this ſecond landing of his when he began it.</p>
               <p>About this time all the Weſtern and Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts too of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire being over-run by the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Huns, Franks,</hi> and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her barbarous partly <hi>German,</hi> partly <hi>Scythick</hi> Nations, and conſequently all kind of Learning for the matter deſtroyed by them where ever they ſet footing: and the little remainders of the learned Contemplative men retiring ſtill from the noiſe of Arms: and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves no where on the Continent, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102628:61"/> as little in Great <hi>Britain</hi> at reſt or in ſafety: many of them at laſt paſſed over to <hi>Ireland.</hi> That is, to a Countrey, where, as they were told for certain (and ſo it was indeed) the <hi>Romans</hi> never challeng'd any right: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently neither could the Barbarians on account of ſuch right pretend any quarrel to it; and yet a Countrey to admiration religious and holy. This of all likelihood was one of the cauſes or means whereby <hi>Ireland</hi> began ſuddenly to flouriſh above any Countrey of <hi>Europe</hi> at that time in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Beſides, and to ſpeak without likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but by the authority of good Authors for matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> their bleſſed Apoſtle St. <hi>Patrick</hi> himſelf at his coming thither to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them in the aforeſaid year, brought with him, beſides other Clerks, in his own Company thirty Biſhops whom himſelf had in his Journey through foreign parts ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and before his ſhipping for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for that miſſion of purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated: becauſe he foreſaw the Harveſt would be very great, and therefore he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many Workmen. So affirmeth an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>French</hi> Author of good repute <hi>Henricus Altiſiodorenſis,</hi> (<note n="c" place="margin">Vitae S. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani, <hi>cap. 168.</hi>
                  </note>) who flouriſh'd in the Emperour <hi>Carolus Calvus</hi>'s Reign. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chronicles tell us, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

So here you may clearly ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe Biſhops, Clerks, and other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the firſt Seminary of that great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Ireland</hi> then, when all the other We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Kingdoms and Provinces were grown illiterate, barbarous, rude.

That <hi>Beannchuir</hi> it ſelf, the happy Mother of ſo bleſſed an Iſſue, had likewiſe of her own peculiar Conventuals at home conſtantly praiſing and ſerving God, ſuch a number, that on a time ſome foreign Pirats Landing there unexpectedly (for't was upon the Sea-ſide) to ſpoil and burn it, as they did both, found nine hundred Monks in the place: whom they ſlew, and burnt alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether moſt inhumanely, as the Hiſtories of that Countrey tell.

That his proper name received in Baptiſm was <hi>Criomhthan:</hi> and the name of <hi>Columb-Cille</hi> was given him by Children, his Play-fellows; who becauſe of his Dove-like ſimplicity, and becauſe when he came to them upon a certain day, once every week, where they with great longing expected him, he always came to them immediatly out of the Church or Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery wherein he was educated (at <hi>Dubghlaiſſa</hi> in <hi>Tirconel</hi>) therefore they, ſo ſoon as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to them, cried forth unanimouſly with one voice, <hi>Columb ne Cille.</hi> Whereof his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors taking notice at laſt, thought it the will of God he ſhould be ſo called thence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by all others too, even as the innocent Children had already and conſtantly once a week by their joyful acclamations begun to do:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102628:67"/> thoſe three diſtinct <hi>Iriſh</hi> words importing in <hi>Engliſh</hi> the <hi>Dove of the Church.</hi> For in that Language <hi>Celumb</hi> is a Dove, and <hi>Ceall,</hi> or <hi>Cill</hi> is a Church, Monaſtery, or Cell. And hence it was that <hi>Criomhthan</hi> came to be generally called no more <hi>Criomhthan,</hi> but <hi>Columb-Cille;</hi> the middle word at firſt uſed by the Children, being left out of the compoſition for brevities ſake. 3. That having in his youth dedicated himſelf to a Monaſtick life, and having by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious mortification arrived to the higheſt pitch of holineſs, he founded the Monaſtery of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Dear-magh,</hi> in Latin <hi>Campus Roborum,</hi> as <hi>Beda</hi> notes.

               <p>16. What follows next, is on the other ſide of the Medal to repreſent unto you not only a mixture of great imperfections with ſo many excellencies, nor only the prevalency of downright evil men againſt ſo many good, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo prodigiouſly numerous and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplars of virtue living among them, after their being enlightned with the doctrine of ſalvation: but, according to the viciſſitude of all things on earth, the change, and wane, and ſtrange decay, and utter fall at laſt of that People in general from all the glory of their Anceſtors. And this, whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the greatneſs of their former dominion and power abroad, or the more ancient policy of their Government at home, or the ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious fame of their Letters and Holineſs every where in thoſe days of old. Nay, and this alteration too, in every point, as happening to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102628:71"/> them even before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had ſet one foot in their Country under <hi>Henry</hi> II. All which I am to repreſent unto you now, becauſe the order of things, and both title and nature of this Tract require I ſhould. Though I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs do it by ſo much the more briefly, by how much I am leſs inclined to dwell on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>However, I muſt confeſs that when I reflect on the moſt authentick Monuments of that Nation, as written by their own moſt ſelect Antiquaries, and believed by themſelves: I am abſorpt in admiration, at the wonderful patience of God with them in particular, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other People that I have read of, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting their amendment ſo long, that is, well nigh 3000 years compleat, before he would quite deſtroy them. A period ſo large, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a far leſs extent of time, his wrath ſubverted utterly the <hi>Aſſyrian, Chaldean, Median, Perſian, Macedonian, Roman</hi> Empires, and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Affric,</hi> and all other Kingdoms or Dominions, how great or how little ſoever any where on earth; whereof we have but the leaſt competent knowledge out of ancient Hiſtory, or other authentick book. And yet he continued ſtill the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation and Monarchy beyond that extent of time. And yet 'tis no leſs apparent in their own Chronicles, that according to the judgment
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102628:71"/> of man, they had as little deſerved the mercy of God as any of their Neighbours, or other the deſtroy'd Nations.</p>
               <p>For to lay aſide their Idolatry, and all the appendants of it, which yet among them in their time of Paganiſm, were as great and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and provoking of Heaven as any where elſe in the world: and to paſs over alſo thoſe other Immoralities of theirs, how enormous ſoever in the ſight of God, which were never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs but common to them with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, reputed the moſt civil among men: certainly (if not among Cannibals, or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrigons, or ſuch other Monſters, unworthy to be called men, or at leaſt to be brought in compariſon with any People that make uſe of reaſon, live in ſociety and approve Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) never has any other Nation upon Earth anneer'd the <hi>Mileſian</hi> race (inhabiting <hi>Ireland)</hi> in the moſt unnatural, bloody, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtructive Feuds that have been heard, or can well be imagin'd. Feuds ſo prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly bloody, that as they were firſt founded, ſo they ſtill encreaſed and continued in blood, even along from the firſt foundation of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchy in the blood of <hi>Heber,</hi> ſhed in Battel by his Brother <hi>Herimon,</hi> until the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Muirchiortach mhac Neill</hi> (the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Monarch ſaving one) by the hands of <hi>Fearrnibh Fearrmhaighe,</hi> and <hi>O Brian,</hi> or even

Theſe prodigious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations of Heaven to that exceſſive degree wherein they were National and peculiar to that People only, and the contemplation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is it that, upon return of it, ſuſpends my ſoul in admiration at the patience of God bearing ſo long with them, in particular, above all other Nations, far leſs guilty for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us in Hiſtory, and much ſooner utterly ſubverted by his revenging hand of juſtice.</p>
               <p>Never have we read of any other People in the World ſo implacably, ſo furiouſly, ſo eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſet upon the deſtruction of one another, as firſt, The Progenies of <hi>Heber</hi> and <hi>Herimon:</hi> then thoſe two or three other deſcended from <hi>Ire</hi> and <hi>Ithe,</hi> and <hi>Breoghuin,</hi> all of the ſame <hi>Mileſian</hi> ſtock or kinred: and then again the two former: and then laſt of all, the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents

To ſay nothing now of thoſe no leſs bloody contentions of others of them very often about <hi>Provincial,</hi> or even leſſer Kingdoms and Rights, after that either theſe or thoſe petty Kingdoms came up. Never have we heard of any other Countrey on Earth, ſo frequently, ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, beyond almoſt all belief afflicted, haraſſed, waſted, turn'd into a Wilderneſs, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Pride of her Nobles, Tyranny of her Princes, Rebellion of their Subjects, Fury of her Men at arms, and other Souldiers, Preying, Sacking, Burning all that ſtood over ground in the Provinces invaded by them. Never has either book or man told us of any Region be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Ireland,</hi> that beheld ſo many of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Fields turn'd ruddy, all cover'd with the bloody gore of above 600 Battels fought on 'em ſo cruelly and unnaturally by her own Children of the ſame Language, Lineage, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious rites, tearing out the lives of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partly for dominion, and often for meer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Never has the Sun beſtowed his light on any other Land, to behold a hundred and eighteen Monarchs ſlaughter'd by the hands of their own diſloyal Native Subjects; four and twenty of them in Battel, and the reſt by down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Aſſaſſination and Murder.

Of all and every of which Fights, and all the reſt whatſoever, except only thoſe but now excepted, the date, and place, and perſons principally concern'd, and particular occaſions too not ſeldom, may be read in the foreſaid Hiſtory of Dr. <hi>Keting.</hi> And among them, ſeaven of thoſe ten Battels fought by <hi>Mogha</hi> againſt <hi>Con Ceadchathach,</hi> particularly named from the places where they were fought, <hi>viz.</hi> the Battels of <hi>Broſnuighe,</hi> and <hi>Sampaire,</hi> and <hi>Greine,</hi> and <hi>Atha-Luaine,</hi> and <hi>Luighe Croich,</hi> and <hi>Aſail,</hi> and <hi>

               <p>17. But that which in this whole account of their Battels fought, and Monarchs kill'd by their own Natives, muſt be not only ſtrange, but aſtoniſhing, is, that the fury extended even to many Ages of Chriſtianity, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in a very great meaſure to the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or duration of their being a free People. In the very firſt four hundred years of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion flouriſhing in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly, as we have ſeen before, with My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102628:76"/> of holy Profeſſors, yet their Princes and Nobles, and other Martial men were as furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly given to the deſtruction of one another, as their Anceſtors had been in the time of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm. In ſo much, that of 33 Monarchs, who (according even to <hi>Polychronicon</hi> and <hi>Cambrenſis)</hi> had Reigned ſucceſſively in that Nation from <hi>Laogirius</hi> (in whoſe Reign, and fourth year of it, S. <hi>Patrick</hi> entred upon the work of their Converſion) to the Reign of <hi>Aodh Ordnigh,</hi> in which the firſt Invaſion and War of the <hi>Danes</hi> upon em began, four and twenty were by their own <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chriſtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects moſt unchriſtianly murder'd in the Iſland of <hi>Saints;</hi> ſix of them in Battel, and eighteen without battel or other ſolemnity or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, than that of the vileſt Aſſaſſination com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on great Princes. Nor were the ſix Battels in which thoſe ſix Monachs were kill'd the only Battels fought in that ſpace of time wherein the primitive fervour of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity moſt flouriſh'd among other Profeſſors of it in that Country. So far otherwiſe, that of thoſe 33 Monarchs who Reign'd in that time before the firſt Landing of the <hi>Danes,</hi> I find but three only, <hi>Aodh Slaine, Colman Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>high,</hi> and <hi>Swine Mean</hi> that were not in Arms againſt any at all, Subjects or Foreigners; who nevertheleſs were all three murdered by ſome wicked Iriſh men, their own Subjects:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102628:76"/> and beſides them, <hi>Blaithmhac</hi> and <hi>Diarmuid Ruannigh,</hi> two Brothers in like manner joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoying the Soveraign Power, and then <hi>Seachnaſach</hi> immediatly ſucceeding, in all three more, that although they were in Arms at home, it was not againſt any of their own People, but the two former againſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Brittons</hi> invading them under the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their General <hi>Brit</hi> (or <hi>Berthus</hi>) and the third againſt the <hi>Picts</hi> Landing in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> whom the Forces of that Province overthrew preſently; and yet he alſo was murdered by his own People. All the reſt of the three and thirty Monarchs had their Swords drawn (whether juſtly or injuſtly I diſpute not here) againſt their own Rebellious Subjects at home; and theſe againſt them. So that beſides infinite depredations, waſtings, burnings of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; beſides the endleſs harraſſing of the poor Peaſants; and even ſometime the violating of Sanctuaries, and burning of Churches, and killing of Clergy men, and Prieſts, and Biſhops too for company; beſides leſſer Fights and skirmiſhes without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: you may read in <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Keting</hi> above 58 main Battels fought between their Princes, Kings, and Monarchs, within that period of time: a period that wanted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eightyears of 400.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:102628:77"/>
               <p>18. And that you may underſtand how bloody, how deſtructive indeed thoſe greater Battels might have generally been: I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance here in two of them. Firſt, in that which they call the Battel of <hi>Allmbain,</hi> wherein about the year of Chriſt, 920. the Monarch <hi>Ferghall mhac Maolduin</hi> with an Army of one and twenty thouſand men invading and fighting <hi>Murchoe mhac Bruin</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> who had but nine thouſand one hundred and ſixty men to oppoſe him, was himſelf kill'd, and together with him ſeven thouſand of his Army on the place; beſides 269 perſons more of them ſo ſtrangely frighted, that they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that kind or heighth of frenzy which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> call in their Language <hi>Dubhghealtacht,</hi> flying over ground, like frighted Fowls from all People they met or ſaw. This ill fortune of this Monarch <hi>Fearghall</hi> was thought to have happend him, becauſe a Party of his men in their march to this Field had ſpoild a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry call'd <hi>Cillin,</hi> and the Anchoret there living had curs'd the Monarch and his whole Army. Secondly, in that which they call the Battel of <hi>Seanaigh</hi> and <hi>Vchaidh,</hi> fought between the Monarch <hi>Aodh Ollan,</hi> and <hi>Aodh Colgan,</hi> King (alſo) of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> yea ſought with that fury on both ſides, that beſides this Monarch himſelf mortally wounded, and a very great ſlaughter of his Army; and beſides <hi>Aodh Colgan</hi> kill'd,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102628:77"/> together with <hi>Bran Beg,</hi> the petty King of half <hi>Leinſter;</hi> nine thouſand more of the <hi>Leinſter</hi> men alone remained dead on the Field; tho the ſaid Monarch died not of his wounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived here, but was kill'd ſometimes after in the Battel of <hi>Seir.</hi> But what I cannot here but particularly take notice of, as worthy of ſpecial remark, are two things. The one, that this fury of purſuing one another with Battels, and Slaughters, and Murders, even all along from their converſion to Chriſtianity, for the extent of 400 years, had been ſo ſtrangely vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that it gave them no leaſure at all to think of preſerving, much leſs enlarging their former Conqueſts.</p>
               <p>In their time of Paganiſm how bloodily ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſeveral Factions had been commonly bent to mutual deſtruction; yet the prevailing Parties now and then had ſuch generous pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick reſolutions, as to give over at home, and employ their Warlike ſpirits abroad to enlarge their Dominions. We have formerly ſeen their brave exploits in ſubduing the <hi>Orcades, Hebrides,</hi> Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> and then all <hi>Scotland;</hi> and then making the reſt of <hi>Great Britain</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary, and laſt of all enterprizing on <hi>France</hi> it ſelf in the decay of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, till <hi>Niall</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> was no leſs treacherouſly than revengfully murder'd there amidſt his Army camping on the River of <hi>Loyrc,</hi> as has been ſaid
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102628:78"/> before. I might alſo have added another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture and enterprize of theirs on <hi>France,</hi> with a reſolute Army under the leading of their Monarch <hi>Dathi,</hi> alias <hi>Fearadhach,</hi> who as in the Sovereignty of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo in his deſign on <hi>France</hi> ſucceeded immediatly to the foreſaid <hi>Niall</hi> the Great: tho having Landed there, and march'd through till he came near the <hi>Alps,</hi> he was here ſtruck dead by a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt from Heaven: for ſo the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chronicles deliver his death. As they do alſo the cauſe of it (according to the conjectures of men) to have been, that he ſuffered the Cell of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian holy <hi>Anchorite,</hi> by name <hi>Parmenius,</hi> to be ranſack'd: who thereupon curſing this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Sacrilegious King, and calling to Heaven for Vengeance, that exemplary puniſhment ſhewed his prayer was heard by God. But whatever the cauſe of it was, the place where it happen'd ſhews how vigorouſly he purſued the brave adventures of ſo many other Pagan Kings and Princes of <hi>Ireland</hi> to enlarge their Dominions abroad.</p>
               <p>19. And becauſe peradventure it may be worth the while, take here in ſhort a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchs, Princes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chief Nobles, who by their firſt ſubduing, and then planting of <hi>Albain</hi> (as they call it) gave it the name of <hi>Scotland. 1.

I ſay this <hi>Aongus</hi> entred <hi>Albuin</hi> to recover of the <hi>Picts</hi> the chiefry due to the King of <hi>Ireland</hi> his Father. Wherein finding them refractory, he gave them and the <hi>Britains,</hi> or <hi>Aborigines,</hi> inhabiting at that time the Northern parts of <hi>Great Britain</hi> ſo many overthrows, that he reduced them at laſt to his own conditions, making them not only Tributarles but Subjects to the Kings of <hi>Ireland:</hi> which happen'd about 250 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the arrival of the <hi>Iberians</hi> there from <hi>Spain,</hi> that is well nigh 2800 years ſince. 2. <hi>Aongus</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Ollmhucuidh</hi> (from his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary great Hogs: for <hi>Muc</hi> in their Language ſignifies a Hog in Engliſh) the XVI. King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Conqueſt, fought the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Firr Bholg</hi> inhabiting the <hi>Orcades,</hi> and other Iſlands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and utterly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued them in 50 Battels. For it was he, and not the foreſaid <hi>Aongus,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Ollbhua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thach</hi> (or the <hi>Victorious</hi>) that fought them and ſubdued all thoſe Iſlanders. And therefore by this obſervation alſo, be pleaſed to correct what you find otherwiſe in the foreſaid 16 <hi>page.</hi> 3. Many centuries after, the ſixtieth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of <hi>Ireland, Reachta Righdhearg</hi> croſſing the narrow Seas, and Landing in <hi>Albain</hi> (as

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> had been made in the time of <hi>Irelands</hi> Paganiſm. I know it happen'd in the 20th. year of the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Lugha (mhac Laoghaire</hi>) Monarch of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was of Chriſt, 493. and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the very next year after <hi>Patricks</hi> death, according to <hi>Ketings</hi> computation; tho ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Jocelinus,</hi> it muſt have been the next ſaving one. I know alſo, it is ſuppoſed by the Writers of this holy mans life, eſpecially <hi>Jocelinus,</hi> c. 191. that even three and thirty years before his death, all <hi>Ireland,</hi> together with the Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> and all other Iſlands then ſubject to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> had been throughly and wholly converted to Chriſtian Religion by him. Which makes it indeed very probable, that this laſt expedition of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was wholly conſiſting of Chriſtian Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers. And yet I am not certain of it for theſe reaſons. 1. Becauſe <hi>Jocelinus</hi> (c. 49.) and others tell us that notwithſtanding all the prodigious wonders done by S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> and many of them in the very preſence of <hi>Laogirius</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, (Father to this <hi>Lugha,</hi>) he was never converted, but died in his Infidelity, being kill'd at <hi>Greallach</hi> (a Village near the River <hi>Liffy</hi> in that Country, which we now call the

                     </gap>imh</hi> (as they call it) or Fine, which he challeng'd from them as due to him and all other Monarchs after him. 2. Becauſe this very Monarch <hi>Luigha,</hi> in whoſe Reign that Expedition of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter Dal-Rheudans,</hi> and ſix Sons of <hi>Muredus</hi> happen'd, tho he lived and continued his Sovereignty 15 years longer, was nevertheleſs at laſt ſtruck likewiſe dead by a Thunderbolt: and the Iriſh Antiquaries of thoſe times have interpreted this Judgment on him as a juſt puniſhment of the great diſreſpects and diſhonour done by him to the ſame extraordinary wonderful Servant of God. And theſe are my reaſons for doubting. For it ſeems not likely, that if <hi>Lugha</hi> had been converted, he would after his Converſion have ſo behaved himſelf towards that Saint, as to incenſe Heaven to puniſh him in ſo dreadful a manner. And as unlikely it is, that in caſe he had ſo miſ-behaved himſelf, during his Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102628:83"/> he would not after his Converſion have repented ſo heartily thereof, as to merit the Saints prayers for him to God, at leaſt for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting ſo terrible a judgment. And then we know how far the example of a wicked Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch might have prevail'd with other wicked men to keep them ſtill in their Infidelity.</p>
               <p>But be this conjecture true or falſe; nay, be it ſuppos'd for certain, that <hi>Lugha</hi> and all <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> every one, and conſequently thoſe ſix Sons of <hi>Muireadhach</hi> King of <hi>

Inſomuch that they gave not themſelves either opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or leiſure to look after not ſo much as the paiment of Chiefries or Tributes due to them from their Dominions abroad in the Iſlands or <hi>Terra Firma</hi> it ſelf of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Not one of all their Monarchs, for ought appears in their Hiſtory, having at any time ſince entertain'd no not a thought of employing their Arms that way, ſave only <hi>Aodh mhac Aiumhiriogh</hi> the 10th. undoubted Chriſtian Monarch, who
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102628:83"/> propos'd it in his great Parliament at <hi>Drom Ceatha,</hi> and was generouſly reſolv'd upon it' until by the cuſtomary obſtacle of a Civil War at home, he was not only ſoon diverted from that reſolution, but himſelf kill'd in the Battel of <hi>Beluigh Duin Bholg,</hi> fought againſt him by <hi>Brandubh</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter;</hi> as this <hi>Brandubh</hi> alſo, not long after, was by his own <hi>Lagenian</hi> Subjects in the Battel of <hi>Cam-Chluana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which you may perceive that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion wrought ſo little on that People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the abatement of their mortal feuds, that under it, even in its firſt four hundred years among them, their Princes were much more fatally engaged in purſuing one another with fire and ſword, and horrid ſlaughters, to the utter undoing of themſelves, and weakning of their Country, and making it an eaſie prey to Foreiners after, than their very Pagan Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors had been, whereof ſo many had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their Dominions far and near, and ſtill enlarged and kept them for ſo many Ages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; whatever in the mean time their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions were at home. And this is one of thoſe two things I would eſpecially remark here.</p>
               <p>12. The other is, That not even the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt holineſs of ſome of their very greateſt and moſt juſtly celebrated Saints has been exempt from the fatality of this genius of putting their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102628:84"/> Controverſies to the bloody deciſion of Battels; tho they foreſaw the death of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands muſt needs have followed, or at leaſt be hazarded to follow. Even <hi>Columb-Cille</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo religious a Monk, Prieſt, Abbot, ſo much a man of God, was nevertheleſs the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Author, Adviſer, Procurer of fighting three ſeveral Battels, namely thoſe of <hi>Cuile-Dreimbne, Cuile-Rathan,</hi> and <hi>Cuile Feadha.</hi> The firſt on this occaſion. At a Parliament held at <hi>Taragh</hi> by the Monarch <hi>Diardmuid mhic Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſſe Ceirrbheoil,</hi> it happened that contrary to the moſt ſacred and ſevere Laws of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg'd place, one <hi>Cuornane mhac Aodh</hi> had kill'd a Gentleman: and that this <hi>Cuorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102628:84"/> God for their good ſucceſs. And it ſeems God was pleaſed to hear his prayer for hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Monarch. For the iſſue of the Battel fought ſo by thoſe <hi>Neales</hi> at <hi>Cuile Druimhne</hi> was, that <hi>Diarmuid</hi> not only ſaw himſelf rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but almoſt his whole Army kill'd in that very Field. The ſecond on this occaſion. <hi>Dal-Narruidh</hi> and other <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltonians</hi> had in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence twixt <hi>Columb-Cille</hi> and <hi>Comghall</hi> ſhewed themſelves unjuſtly partial againſt <hi>Columb,</hi> as he thought. And therefore he had the Battel of <hi>Cuile Rathan</hi> fought againſt them. Who this <hi>Comghall</hi> was, I cannot certainly tell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho I think he might be the great <hi>Comghall,</hi> alias <hi>Congellus,</hi> Founder and Abbot of <hi>Beannchuir,</hi> of whom ſo much has been ſaid before. I am ſure he and <hi>Colum-Cille</hi> were contemporaries, and of the ſame Province of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter.</hi> But for being Author of the third Battel, <hi>Columb-Cille</hi> had a much more ſpecious cauſe (it I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to interpoſe my ſimple judgment) than either of the two former. <hi>Baodhan mhac Niue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adha,</hi> who had been Monarch but one whole year, being in ſome extraordinary danger from his Enemies, <hi>Columb-Cille</hi> paſs'd his word in the nature of a Sanctuary to him, to keep him ſafe in that extremity. Which <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane mhac Colmain</hi> not regarding, he had him ſet upon and murder'd by the two <hi>Cummins</hi> (viz. <hi>Cummin mhac Colmain Bhig,</hi> and <hi>Cummin
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102628:85"/> in hac Libhrein</hi>) at <hi>Carrig Leime in Eich,</hi> or the Horſe-leap in <hi>Jomairge.</hi> And this was the cauſe that moved <hi>Columb-Cille</hi> to perſuade and be Author of the Battel of <hi>Cuile Feadha,</hi> fought againſt <hi>Colmane mhac Diarmuda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, That whatever, or how juſt ſoever the cauſes of each, or all thoſe three Battels had ſeem'd to <hi>Columb-Cille;</hi> yet the holy Biſhop <hi>Molaiſſe</hi> was ſo far from approving any of them, that for engaging in them any way, he not only moſt ſeverely reproved <hi>Columb-Cille,</hi> but enjoyn'd him the grievous pennance of departing preſently out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and never more during life to ſee it. It is alſo true, that <hi>Columb-Cille</hi> with all humility and readineſs obeying this injunction departed forthwith to <hi>Scotland:</hi> where the power of God was with him ſo eminently in converting ſuch vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Infidels to Chriſt, as if God himſelf from all eternity had preordained thoſe three Battels to be the occaſion of ſaving the <hi>Picts.</hi> And no leſs true it is, That when the great Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> was ſummon'd by the Monarch <hi>Aodh mhac Ainmhirogh</hi> to aſſemble at <hi>Drom Ceatha,</hi> as they did, and ſate there thirteen months, without intermiſſion or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, debating principally thoſe three things which he propoſed to them. 1. That of Baniſhing for ever all the Poets out of the Kingdom, by reaſon of their being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102628:85"/> intolerable burden to the People. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you may ſee ſtrange particulars, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing account.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>This was the fourth time the Poets (whom the</hi> Iriſh <hi>in their Language call</hi> Ollamhs) <hi>were by a general Decree all of them condemn'd to Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into</hi> Dal-Riada <hi>in</hi> Scotland, <hi>by reaſon of their inſolency, exceſſive number, and burthen to the People. For 1. They beg'd all what-ever ſeem'd to be moſt valued by the Noble-men; who out of a fooliſh cuſtom that prevail'd too long, could deny them nothing. And therefore they had the impudence to beg of this very Monarch</hi> Aodh mhac Ainmhiriogh <hi>the richeſt and moſt precious Jewel in all his Treaſury, and had it. 2. Their number was near a third part of the People of</hi> Ireland. <hi>So ſays</hi> Keting, <hi>if my Copy of his work be right. There was a thouſand of them that kept Trains of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderlings waiting on them continually where-ever they went. The chiefeſt of all had 30 men, for his own particular train. The next to him 15. and ſo forth deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; every one of them had ſome number in his own proper retinue, to the very laſt of 1000 leading Poets. 3. They were all of 'em, with all their numerous trains, yearly ceſs'd on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inhabitants of the Kingdom from</hi> All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallows-day <hi>till</hi> May-day, <hi>even ſix entire months of the year. And theſe I think were ſufficient reaſons to Baniſh them, as I have ſaid they were
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102628:86"/> three ſeveral times before this Parliament of</hi> Drom-Ceatha <hi>had been chiefly called for the ſame end. For you are to underſtand, that after each of their former Baniſhments they were ſtill harbour'd in the</hi> North <hi>until they procur'd licence to return to all the other Provinces. The firſt time, being a thouſand in number, at the interceſſion of</hi> Columb-Cille, <hi>who went in behalf of</hi> Conchabhar <hi>King of</hi> Ulſter, <hi>to meet and invite them, they were ſtaid, received and maintain'd by him and his Nobles of that Province till ſeven years were over. The ſecond time by</hi> Fiachna mhac Baodhaine <hi>King of</hi> Ulſter, <hi>but for one year only, their number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeven hundred. The third time by</hi> Maob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choba <hi>King of</hi> Ulſter; <hi>likewiſe one whole year, when their number was full 1200. But this fourth time, at the Parliament at</hi> Drom-Ceatha, <hi>tho</hi> Colum-Cille <hi>had interpoſed for them all he could, yet being convinc'd by the Monarch's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he acquieſed at laſt in what was decreed there, not only for the ſuppreſſion of their multitudes, and reformation of their abuſes, and eaſe of the People; but even for preſervation of their own Language, Laws, Poetry, Hiſtory, Genealogy, and Chronology, arts both uſeful and delightful to all ingenious Men, and civil Nations. As 1. That the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, Provincial, and other leſſer Kings, and every Lord of a Cantred (or Barony) ſhould each of them entertain a Poet of his own; beſtow on him and his Poſterity for ever, a competent Eſtate
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102628:86"/> in Lands, to live upon; and that both his Perſon, Lands, and other Goods ſhould be exempt from all publick duties. 2. That for preſerving the ſciences they profeſs'd, there ſhould be ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Free Schools both appointed and endowed with Lands by the Eſtates of the Kingdom in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. And purſuant to this Decree thoſe two in</hi> Breithfne, <hi>the one at</hi> Rath-Ceanaidh, <hi>the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other at</hi> Magh-Sleacht, <hi>were eſtabliſh'd. 3. That the Monarch's Poet or</hi> Ollamh, <hi>ſhould be the</hi> Ard-Ollamh, <hi>that is Arch-Poet and Arch-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of their knowledge: and that he ſhould have the appointment of, and a ſuperintendency too over the reſt. 4. And laſtly none otherwiſe, or above this number to be allow'd.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>2. That of depoſing <hi>Scanlane Mor mhac Ceanfoaladh,</hi> King of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> who was then his Priſoner, and committed even by Authority of that Parliament, for his refuſing to pay the ſaid Monarch a certain annual rent challeng'd as due from him. 3. That of invading <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with a Royal Army to force the payment of Chiefry, Tributes, and other Duties for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly paid thence to his Predeceſſors. And when <hi>Columb-Cille</hi> was perſuaded to go thither out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of purpoſe to intercede for the Poets, interpoſe for his devoted Friend the ſaid <hi>Scanlane Mor</hi> King of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and to divert the Monarch from his reſolution of invading <hi>Scotland:</hi> nevertheleſs he was ſo rigorouſly, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102628:87"/> even ſo literally obſervant of that pennance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd him by <hi>Molaiſſe,</hi> that he had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally during the whole time of going thither, ſtaying there, and returning back, a Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath in ſuch manner hanging down before his eyes, that he never ſaw light all the while, nor did at any time after during life, as neither before ſince the command laid upon him by <hi>Molaiſſe,</hi> any part or foot of <hi>Irelands</hi> ground.</p>
               <p>Which admirable inſtance of the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reſignation of his will, judgment, ſoul, to the greateſt exactneſs of Chriſtian diſcipline, together with the prodigious auſterity of his life, and mortification of his body, by watching and faſting to ſuch a degree, that he ſeem'd a very Skeleton alive: even all his ribs, and other bones of that ſide whereon he lay on the ſandy ground, which was his ordinary bed in his little Cell, being perfectly countable in the print of them remaining there, when he roſe up from it I ſay that all this together duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, beſides his continual prayer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, makes me not wonder at all that he ſhould have both converted Nations, and wrought ſo many ſtupendious miracles above all the power of Nature by invoking God, as are reported of him in his life. Nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that in this very Parliament of <hi>Drom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eath,</hi> upon denial of his two laſt requeſts, the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102628:87"/> one for ſetting at liberty the foreſaid King of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> the other for not making War on <hi>Dal-Rheuda</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or requiring Chiefry or other duties of them any more, he ſhould, as he was departing and taking his leave of them, ſo confidently have prayed to God, and withal prophetically told the Monarch there in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. 1. That <hi>Scanlane Mor</hi> ſhould be freed that very night by God himſelf, and be with him wherever he ſhould chance to be that ſame night before he went to midnight Prayers. 2. That <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould never more pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, chief rent, or other duty of ſubjection to <hi>Ireland.</hi> Both which predictions were to a tittle accompliſh'd. But theſe matters, either of his auſterity, or ſanctity, or miraculous power, and prophetical ſpirit are foreign to this place.</p>
               <p>And therefore I return to tell you, that I had no other deſign in relating thoſe three Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels fought by his authority, than to let you ſee by ſuch convincing proofs the native genius of that People, even in thoſe early days of Ghri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity flouriſhing among them in all its glory. A fatal genius indeed, to put their controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies to the deciſive judgment of the God of Hoſts in Battel, without regard either of any other way of arbitration of man, or of ſo many thouſand of unfortunate men that periſh'd ſtill by this bloody Teſt, or even of the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102628:88"/> weakning of their Country by it; and this to ſuch a degree as muſt have expos'd them all at laſt an eaſie prey to Foreigners. Yet ſuch their genius was, and ſo it continued ſtill. Neither Monarchs, nor Provincial Kings, nor other Princes or Leaders among them ſeem'd to be at all moved by the holy injunction of <hi>Molaiſſe,</hi> or penitential divine obſervation of it by <hi>Columb-Cille</hi> all his life after, in expiating his former zeal. They, notwithſtanding all their Chriſtianity, went on all of them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the old beaten road, either of Battels, (or which was worſe) of Murders, even from this very Monarch <hi>Aodh Aimmhiriogh</hi> for 300 years more. That is, juſt as their Predeceſſors had done before in the very firſt century of that holy religion among them. For it was within this earlieſt and holieſt Age of all, that we read of ſix of their firſt Chriſtian Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns of <hi>Ireland</hi> downright murdered by their own Subjects at home, beſides one more kill'd in Battel by them: <hi>Baodhan mhac Nineadha,</hi> by the two <hi>Cummins: Ainmhire mhac Seadna,</hi> by <hi>Ferghuſſa mhac Neill: Diarmuid mhac Ferg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huſſa Ceirbheoil</hi> by <hi>Aodh Dubh mhac Suibhne:</hi> the two Brothers who joyntly ruled, <hi>Eochae</hi> and <hi>Baodhan,</hi> by <hi>Cronan mhac Tighernaigh</hi> King of <hi>Cionachta Ghlinne Geimhion: Tuathal Maolg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harubh,</hi> by <hi>Maolmortha</hi> at a place called <hi>Grealla Eillte:</hi> and <hi>Oilloll Molt</hi> the firſt of them all,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102628:88"/> in the Battel of <hi>Ocha,</hi> by <hi>Lugha mhac Laoghaire,</hi> who thereupon immediatly ſucceeded him in the Soveraignty: S. <hi>Patrick</hi> himſelf their great Apoſtle being yet alive among them.</p>
               <p>22. To this unhappy Unchriſtian genius of the Princes and Nobles among that People for righting themſelves, or deciding their quarrels whether right or wrong, by their own ſwords either in Battel, or the baſer way of ſurprizal and murder, you may add, as no leſs worthy of ſpecial remark, the higheſt injuſtice of too many of their Monarchs both Heathen and Chriſtian, in puniſhing the perſonal crime of one man by laying intolerable Fines on whole Provinces at their pleaſures, and exacting them by Military execution, if otherwiſe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely paid. For example, <hi>Aongus Ainchille</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> having in the time of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm Married <hi>Dairin</hi> one of the two only Daughters of <hi>Tuathal Teachtuar</hi> the 101. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and within a little time after viſited his Father in Law at <hi>Tarach,</hi> and made him believe that <hi>Dairin</hi> was dead, and then prayed that for the greater ſtrengthning of their Friendſhip he might have his other Daughter and her Siſter (by name <hi>Fithir</hi>) to Wife, and by earneſt ſuit obtained her: She was no ſooner brought home by him to his own Houſe, than ſeeing her Siſter alive, and thereby finding her ſelf abuſed, not only ſhe,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102628:89"/> through extremity of ſhame ſeizing her, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell down dead in the place, but <hi>Dairin</hi> likewiſe through exceſs of grief breath'd out her laſt upon her Siſters Corps in the very ſame place, and almoſt ſame moment of time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying ſo her Ghoſt to the other life with her own. Which coming to the Monarch, their Fathers knowledge, did ſo enrage him, that entring <hi>Leinſter</hi> with a mighty Force to deſtroy all the People of that whole Province indiſtinctly with Fire and Sword, though they knew nothing at all of the crime; he could not be otherwiſe appeas'd or withdrawn from this reſolution, than by their univerſal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for themſelves and Poſterity after them to a Fine <hi>(Eirick</hi> they call it) of 6000 <hi>Beeves, 6000 Muttons, 6000 fat Hogs, 6000 Mantles, 6000 Cauldrons or Pots of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>aſs, and 6000 ounces of Silver,</hi> to be every ſecond year paid by them to him, and all future Kings of <hi>Ireland</hi> for ever. A Fine indeed both heavy, unjuſt, tyrannical, and which added ſo mightily to their former feuds, that upon the ſole account of it divers Battels have been fought; and much even Chriſtian blood in after-Ages ſpilt. For one third of it was for the <hi>Conacians,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Oirghillians</hi> or <hi>Methians,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Clanna Neills</hi> of the North: as who had all of 'em aſſiſted that Monarch <hi>Tuathal Teachtvar</hi> with their Forces to impoſe it. And
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102628:89"/> fourty Monarchs in a continual ſucceſſion after him, did even by Fire land word exact the payment of it when refuſed, until at laſt <hi>Fio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachtae Fleadhach</hi> the four or five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Chriſtian Monarch, did about the year of Chriſt 922. at the interceſſion of S. <hi>Moling,</hi> ſet <hi>Leinſter</hi> free by remitting and aboliſhing it for ever after.</p>
               <p>Another example here of, might be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Fine laid (about 160 years before <hi>Tuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal Teachtuar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>23. After the great injuſtice and bloody couſequences of thoſe Tyrannical <hi>Eiriocks,</hi> what I purpos'd next to obſerve as moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is the greateſt cruelty, the ſtrangeſt inſulting carriage, and the moſt inhuman ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of ſome other Monarchs, even towards the very Provincial Kings of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when their Captives or at their mercy. To conclude this point, I give three inſtances; the firſt of a Pagan, and the other two of two Chriſtian Monarchs.</p>
               <p>Firſt inſtance. Upon the death of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch <hi>Criomthan mhac Fiodae,</hi> poyſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d by his own Siſter, and <hi>Niall Naoighiollach</hi>'s ſucceeding him, but not yet poſſeſs'd of <hi>Taragh,</hi> the Royal Manſion of the Monarchs, <hi>Eochae</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> pretending ſome title to the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, anticipates him, and poſſeſſes that place. But <hi>Nialls</hi> Magitian or chief <hi>Druid,</hi> by name <hi>Laighichin mhac Bairrchedha,</hi> diſſuades him on the religious, or rather indeed ſuperſtitious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, That none could ſuccesfully poſſeſs <hi>Taragh,</hi> who had not been created a <hi>Niadh-Naisk,</hi> that is a Knight of the celebrated <hi>Chain,</hi> call'd in their Language <hi>Naisk.</hi> Which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever receiv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d with due ſolemnity about their necks, were ſtiled <hi>Niadha-Naisk,</hi> importing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102628:91"/> in <hi>Iriſh</hi> the ſame with <hi>Milites Torquati</hi> in Latin. For this of the <hi>Chain</hi> was an Order, and the only Order of Knighthood among 'em. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Eochae</hi> who had never been receiv'd into that Order, nor had that <hi>Chain</hi> about his neck, being thus diſſuaded, and retiring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently into <hi>Leinſter,</hi> but in his way lodging unluckily a night in the ſaid Magitians Houſe, it happen'd that on ſome provoking Language given him by his Son, he kill'd him preſently in the place. This with all vehemency is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated to <hi>Niall</hi> by the old Magician, Father to him that was kill'd. And <hi>Niall</hi> thereupon egg'd on partly by <hi>Eochaes</hi> late attempt on <hi>Taragh,</hi> and partly by the extream inceſſant opportunity of <hi>Barrechedba</hi> to lay all <hi>Leinſter</hi> in aſhes for the death of his Son, enters that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince with ſo vaſt an Army that no power of the <hi>Lagenians</hi> was able to withſtand him: and with ſuch a revengeful bloody reſolution too, that no prayers, no tears, no offers of the <hi>Leinſter</hi> Nobility, though meeting him of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and humbling themſelves before him, could obtain any other anſwer from him, than that he was reſolved without delay to ruin their whole Province with the utmoſt devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imaginable, unleſs they did forth with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver into his hands their King. <hi>Eochae</hi> ſeeing this deſperate condition of his people, like a brave, juſt, and noble Prince, conſidering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102628:92"/> to be the only Criminal, chooſes rather to loſe his own life, than they who were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſhould theirs: and therefore delivers himſelf freely up. But the mercileſs Monarch, not moved either with his generoſity or humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, commands him to be tied preſently and ſtraightly about the middle with a ſtrong iron Chain, to a huge ſtone like a Rock, which to this day ſtands an end on a Field that is on the Weſt-ſide of the River <hi>Slaine,</hi> between <hi>Kilbride</hi> and <hi>Tullo-O-Feilimm,</hi> in the County of <hi>Cather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logh:</hi> both ends of the chain carried through a hole that ran from one ſide to another in the Stone, and then faſtned in the backſide with an Iron-bar put into both the extream links: and then nine bloody Fellows well arm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to attack him, and mangle him in pieces, while he had nothing at all, no kind of weapon to defend himſelf. Though God and Nature, and the horror of ſo baſe a death did help him ſo ſtrangely, or rather miraculouſly indeed, that ſeeing himſelf in this caſe (for his back was to the Stone, and his face to the People:) and hearing at laſt the word given to his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, who were yet at a little diſtance off: he thereupon rouſed up his ſpirits ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that by violent ſtraining of himſelf, he tore in pieces the Chain before the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were come ſo near as to reach him: and with part of thoſe very pieces laid about him,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102628:92"/> ſo that ſome of the Villains lay dead at his feet, and he eſcaped the reſt by running away.</p>
               <p>Whereby it ſeems that God himſelf in his ſecret Counſels had deſign'd ſo ſtrange a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Eochae</hi> at this time, that he might be at another time in his own very perſon the puniſher of that extraordinary cruel judgment given by <hi>Niall</hi> againſt him. For ſo in truth it happen'd at laſt in this manner following<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Eochae,</hi> as now it has been related, having ſaved his life firſt by his valour, and then by his heels, to ſhun <hi>Nialls</hi> further cruelty, gets himſelf away, ſo ſoon as he could privatly, over into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he is <hi>incognito</hi> receiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the protection of <hi>Gabhran mhac Domhung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoirt,</hi> King of <hi>Dal-Riadd</hi> there, and of all the <hi>Scots.</hi> And after ſome years more expired, when this <hi>Scottiſh</hi> King had by commands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from that (now mighty) Monarch <hi>Niall,</hi> with all the power he could make and ſpare out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> paſs'd over to him in <hi>France</hi> (or <hi>Gaule,</hi> as it then was call'd) <hi>Eochae</hi> accompanies him ſtill <hi>incognito:</hi> and ſo conceals himſelf, until at laſt he found his opportunity at the River <hi>Loyre:</hi> where, as you have it before, he treacherouſly ſlew (by the flight of an Arrow) in the very mid'ſt of his Royal conquering Army, this otherwiſe invincible, though cruel Prince. But theſe later paſſages of <hi>Eochaes</hi> preſervation, and revenge (as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102628:93"/> indeed any other of the evil conſequences following, which were many and great) are to my purpoſe now. And therefore I proceed to the</p>
               <p>Second inſtance. Which though it have not ſo much either effectual or intentional cruelty, yet peradventure it ſhews the ſtrangeſt inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carriage of one Chriſtian Prince a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror towards another, not taken in Battel, or otherwiſe, but freely coming in of himſelf, and ſubmitting to his mercy, that ever has been delivered in writing. <hi>Diarmuid mhac Ferghuſſa, mhic Ceirrbheoil,</hi> of whom I have ſaid before, that he was the Tenth Chriſtian, and now ſay that he was not only a Chriſtian, but perhaps of the very beſt Chriſtian Monarchs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being held for many reſpects a very good man, and very juſt King: ſo juſt, if not rather over juſt he was, that he put his own Son <hi>Breaſſal</hi> to death upon the complaint of an old Religious woman of <hi>Kill-Ealchruidh,</hi> That notwithſtanding the immunity of that Sacred place, and her own right, he had forc'd from her a Cow, becauſe it was extraordinary fat, or to his liking, for a Feaſt, though indeed he had firſt offered her ſeven Cows, and a Bull too in compenſation: this very <hi>Diarmuid,</hi> I ſay, in the ſeventh year of his Reign, and upon the like complaint of another Nun called <hi>Sinioch Chro,</hi> about one ſingle Cow taken from her,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102628:93"/> having made a ſharp War on <hi>Guaire mhac Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> Provincial King of <hi>Connaght,</hi> by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing him in a great Battel: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this <hi>Guaire,</hi> who was no leſs held as good a King as ever <hi>Connaght</hi> had, hoſpitable to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, bountiful without compare, ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the Poor, that he never denied a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Alms to any ſuch perſon craving it in the name of Chriſt; inſomuch, that when at any time he wanted money about him, he ſtrip'd himſelf, and gave his very Cloaths off his back to help them: I ſay this <hi>Guaire,</hi> ſo good a man and King too, after his ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, rallying his Troops again the next day, and then conſulting the Chief among 'em, whether he ſhould venture another Fight, or go freely of himſelf and ſubmit to <hi>Diarmuids</hi> mercy: and by their advice chooſing the latter, and therefore going preſently to the Victors Camp, entring his Tent, and laying himſelf in an humble poſture on his knees before him, begging pardon: <hi>Diarmuid</hi> nevertheleſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard either of the inconſtancy of Fortune, or of <hi>Guaire</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s voluntary ſubmiſſion, or penitent poſture, or of his regal dignity, or of his renowned vertues, without other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or more adoe, commands him to lie down on his back, while himſelf ſtanding up, held one foot on his breaſt, and the point of his Sword between his fore-teeth. 'Tis true,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102628:94"/> that after this trial made, he did <hi>Guaire</hi> no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurt; yet that does not wipe off the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive pride and barbarity of the action or trial it ſelf.</p>
               <p>How ever, before I paſs from this inſtance, it will not be amiſs to let the Reader know, that notwithſtanding all the praiſes given by <hi>Keting</hi> to this <hi>Connaught</hi> King <hi>Guaire,</hi> yet he was the very man (as even <hi>Keting</hi> himſelf elſewhere relates it) who had the Biſhop <hi>Ceallach,</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to St. <hi>Cieran</hi> of <hi>Cluan mhac Noiſe,</hi> and eldeſt Son to <hi>Eoghan Bell,</hi> the former King of <hi>Connacht,</hi> murdered by three of that Biſhops own Servants: which happen'd in the Reign of the former Monarch <hi>Tuathal Maolgharbh.</hi> Theſe Villains <hi>Guaire</hi> ſuborn'd to commit this horrid ſacriledge: and this only on account or ſuppoſition of the ſaid Biſhops endeavouring to make friends for his own younger Brother to recover that Kingdom of <hi>Connaght,</hi> which his Father <hi>Eoghain Bell</hi> had ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enjoy'd, and held all along till death.</p>
               <p>Third inſtance, and it is an inſtance, I think, of very inhuman rigour. <hi>Aodh Ainmhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riogh,</hi> another Chriſtian Monarch of this time (for he came to the Sovereignty within eight years after <hi>Diarmuids</hi> death; and we have ſpoken of him before, as who held the great Parliament for 13 months at <hi>Dromceatha</hi>) was ſo rigorous to <hi>Scanlane Mor mhac Cinfoale,</hi> King
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102628:94"/> of <hi>Oſſory</hi> being his Priſoner, that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be ſtraightly bound in Priſon with twelve chains of Iron loading him; fed only with ſalt Beef; allowed not a drop of any kind of liquor, no not ſo much as of water to drink; had all this rigour effectually put in execution againſt him, and rejected even <hi>Columb-Cille</hi>'s Petition for his releaſe, though come of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe out of <hi>Scotland</hi> to obtain it.</p>
               <p>And ſo I have done with my Inſtances, nor have I more to ſay in reference to them. Only that although I cannot tell what reaſons either of theſe two Chriſtian Monarchs had for ſuch extream rigour towards Chriſtian Princes of their own Nation, though their Priſoners, or at their mercy: nor can tell, as to particulars, how conſiderably this cruel uſage did add unto, or inflame the former feuds: Yet this much I can tell, that neither of them had other than a violent death: the former murder'd by <hi>Aodh Dubh mhac Suibhne;</hi> the later kill'd in Battel by <hi>Brandubh</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon another occaſion. And ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence I have likewiſe done with all my ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial remarks on this large ſubject of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold bloody Feuds of that Nation, both in the time of their Paganiſm, and in that of their being under the Goſpel of Chriſt: for I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no more ſuch heer than I have given.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:102628:95"/>
               <p>Which is the reaſon, that now returning once more thither, where I was before, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude at laſt this long <hi>Section</hi> with one general remark on that People, as they were under the Goſpel in the more early Ages of it among them. <hi>viz.</hi> That from the killing of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Chriſtian Monarch <hi>Aodh mhac Ainmhiriogh</hi> (the laſt we ſpake of here) the Fate not only of the <hi>Mileſians,</hi> but other <hi>Gathelians</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Genius</hi> of their Kings, Princes, Nobles, and other Martial men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing for 300 years after him, the very ſame it had been in the Age before him, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them on perpetually, from time to time, fighting, and ſlaying, and murthering one another at home, until the four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of thoſe Chriſtian Monarchs of theirs, who died violent deaths by the hands of their own <hi>Iriſh</hi> Subjects within the firſt 400 years of Chriſtian Religion generally planted among 'em, by name <hi>Aodh Ollann,</hi> had been ſlaughter'd in the Battel of <hi>Seir</hi> by <hi>Domhnal mhac Murchadha,</hi> that immediatly ſucceeded him.

               <p>24. SUch were the National provocations of Heaven, peculiar to that People hitherto, <hi>i. e.</hi> for two and twenty hundred years (beſides what we ſhall yet ſee did hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen after) above any other Nation of the whole Earth. Immortal Feuds of death, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical oppreſſions of the Subject, cruelty as well of juſtice as revenge, Treaſon, Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, Rebellions, Murders even of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, effuſion of human blood like water. And this without pity, without remorſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cauſe ſometimes but very ſlight, and ſometimes vain and ridiculous. An arbitration between two religious Monks in a difference, deciding againſt one of them, muſt engage
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102628:97"/> Families and Countrys in Arms, to fight it out in Battel, and cut one another in pieces. A known Murtherer proſcrib'd as unpardouable by their moſt ſacred Laws, and therefore juſtly put to death by the Monarch, muſt neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, on pretence of his being ſeiz'd upon after he had been received into the protection of an Abbot, be a juſt cauſe of rebelling and fighting that very Monarch, and killing his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to boot. Nay, one ſingle Beaſt, a Cow, at moſt but very little worth, taken away I know not how from the owner, was the only cauſe of a great Battel fought between the ſame Monarch and the Provincial King of <hi>Connaught,</hi> and a Battel wherein moſt of the Gentry of that Province and <hi>Mounſter</hi> too were kill'd.

               <p>I ſay nothing of the Candle-ſnuff, or of its firing the Monarch <hi>Cormack <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lfada</hi>'s beard at an entertainment given him in <hi>Maig-Breag</hi> by <hi>Giolla</hi> King of <hi>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102628:97"/> this ridiculous matter happen'd or paſs'd at that time, it coſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> dear, long after <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack</hi>'s death. That <hi>Muireadhach Tiriogh,</hi> the great Grand-child of this <hi>Cormack;</hi> and ſixth King of <hi>Ireland</hi> after him, took it for a pretence to pour an Army of one and twenty thouſand men under the command of the three <hi>Collaes</hi> into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> to deſtroy it, and conquer as much Land for themſelves in it as they could. That in purſuance of this Order, they made ſo ſharp War on <hi>Ferghus Fogha</hi> King of <hi>Eumhna</hi> there, that in ſeven ſeveral Fights againſt him, fought ſeven days conſequently, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of one free day, they had the killing and taking of all the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> Forces: having as they beat 'em, ſtill purſued them all along from <hi>Cearnagha</hi> to <hi>Gleann Ruigh.</hi> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſters of the Field, they returned back to <hi>Eumhna,</hi> ſpoil'd it, burn'd it, and deſtroy'd it ſo, that never after any King reſided there. Finally, that by this expedition they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd for themſelves the large Territories of <hi>Modharnaigh, Vibh Criomthaine,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ibh mhic Vaiſe,</hi> which their Poſterities after them did hold, while the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Kingdom ſtood in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I paſs over theſe matters depending on <hi>Cormack</hi>'s beard: not becauſe he and the reſt mention'd in this ſtory were Pagans (for I ſhall have occaſion yet to ſpeak ſomewhat, tho
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102628:98"/> but little, of as great Pagans as they:) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe peradventure the cauſe it ſelf was not ſlight. Tho however I muſt acknowledg the puniſhment was too ſevere and unjuſt: as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inflicted on the Criminals, nor on any that ought in ſuch a diſtance of time to ſuffer for them; much leſs after legal ſummons, or any reſpit given them, to make reparation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der peril of abiding the juſtice of Arms. But leaving this to the Readers judgment,</p>
               <p>I return back to the Chriſtian Princes, where I was before animadverting the ſport they made, on the ſligteſt cauſes that well might be, of the lives of ſo many thouſands of other Chriſtians, their own faithful Friends and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Yet what I am to conſider now, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. It is, That all this while nor they nor their Succeſſors after 'em for 300 years more, ſeem'd any way ſenſible that the All-avenging God began already to warn them. For ſo in truth he did, and that not once nor twice, but much oftner, within that very term of time, even while they were in their full career perſecuting one another at home, with the greateſt violence of deadly Foes. In which reſpect he dealt far otherwiſe, that is much more kindly and mercifully with them, than he had done with their Pagan Fore-fathers in that very Land; upon whom, about a hundred years after their conquering it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102628:98"/> any ſuch gracious Fatherly warnings given them (for ought we find in Hiſtory) he laid on a ſudden the whole weight of his heavy hand in a moſt prodigious manner, at two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times. For what could be more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prodigious than that which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated before, and you may remember here, three parts of four of all the people of <hi>Ireland,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Monarch <hi>Tighernmhuir</hi> (who was the tenth from <hi>Heber</hi>) ſlain in one only night upon <hi>Maigh-Sleacht,</hi> by inviſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the Executioners of Gods fury enrag'd againſt them? Or what, next to that, could be more prodigiouſly terrible than a rich Plain of forty miles long, and fourteen, fifteen, ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles broad, in moſt places, throughly planted, and thick of Inhabitants, in <hi>

               <p>How-ever, becauſe their heinous Idolatry, <hi>i. e.</hi> their univerſal adoration and proſtration of themſelves before their grand Idol <hi>Crom Chruoigh,</hi> which by all circumſtances, was the ſin that brought upon 'em the former of thoſe two ſtupendious Judgments, though it was

               <p>Beſides theſe ſeveral Inroads touching them pretty near the quick at home, in divers parts of their Country, the mercy of God, ſeeing not their amendment yet, was pleas'd in this very <hi>Loinnſioch</hi>'s Reign to try other means more general to the whole Nation of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by afflicting them all with ſuch a Mortality of their Kine, and Famin thence enſuing and continuing for three years, in ſuch extremity, that men ate one another, as <hi>Keting</hi> writes. But neither was this kind of warning any whit more effectual to work a Reformation.

And though <hi>Flaithiortoch,</hi> immediate Succeſſor to the laſt of theſe three, eſcaped violent death by making himſelf the only happy man of all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchs (at leaſt of all until his time, except <hi>Maolchoba</hi>) in putting off voluntarily his Royal Robe, changing it for a Religious Weed, and both living and dying in peace, a profeſs'd Monk in the Monaſtery of <hi>Ardmagh;</hi> yet he that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him next in the Sovereignty, <hi>Aodh Ollan</hi> was kill'd in Battel by <hi>Domhnal mhac Murchadha,</hi> as we have ſeen before.</p>
               <p>All which notwithſtanding, the patience and goodneſs of God to them ſtill was ſuch, that he would warn them yet, and warn 'em indeed now even by prodigies and wonders, both in Heaven above, and in the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. In the Reign of this <hi>Domhnal mhac Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadha,</hi> who both kill'd and ſucceeded <hi>Aodh Ollan,</hi> the form of a hideous horrible Serpent appear'd a long time, moving over their heads in the Firmament.

               <p>Theſe particulars I have omitted before: and therefore give them now for better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Reader. 1. <hi>Every Canthred, or Diviſion of ground containing one of our Baronies, had a</hi> Daniſh <hi>King: every Tuath, or Seigniory, a Chieftain: every Church a Lay</hi>-Daniſh-<hi>Heathen Abbot: every Town a Serjeant: every Houſe a Souldier Ceſs'd (the</hi> Iriſh <hi>call'd him a</hi> Sairioch, <hi>or</hi> Buanna:) <hi>all of 'em</hi> Danes; <hi>and each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding abſolutely within his own Precinct, only ſubordinate reſpectively to the higher, till they came to the Supream, who was</hi> Turgeſius <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> 2. <hi>The very</hi> Buanna <hi>did ſo command the Houſe wherein he was Ceſs'd, that not ſo much as an Egg, or cup of Milk could be diſpoſed of till he had been ſerv'd; though in the mean time a Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Babe did periſh for want of it.

               <p>Thoſe other manifold particulars of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> bondage undoubtedly true, beſides all their riches loſt, and all their beſt blood ſpill'd, and all their Provinces and Countries laid in Aſhes, during this firſt <hi>Daniſh</hi> War, before they were totally ſubdued, give us to underſtand ſufficiently, to what degree their everlaſting feuds and obſtinacy had incenſed Heaven. An obſtinacy it was indeed ſo ſtrangely, ſo inveterately and unreclaimably fix'd, that not even all the preſent terrors of ſo many mighty Fleets of thoſe Heatheniſh cruel Barbarians, pouring in Armies and new Supplies conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102628:105"/> for ſo many years together from all the four winds, into all their Provinces, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, or make them relent.</p>
               <p>For 1. <hi>Aodh Ordnighe</hi> himſelf, the Monarch in whoſe Reign the <hi>Danes</hi> begun their firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> after he had twice in one month prey'd and ſpoil'd <hi>Leinſter,</hi> was by one <hi>Maolcannaid,</hi> in the Battel of <hi>Fearta,</hi> fighting againſt his own Rebellious <hi>Iriſh</hi> Subjects, kill'd. 2. The next ſucceeding him, namely <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabhar mhac Donchadha,</hi> who Reigned 14. years, though he had the fortune to die in his Bed, and (for ought I can find) never once in his life to have fought the <hi>Danes,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their ſore incurſions often made upon his Subjects within that extent of time: yet he had the good leiſure, and took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of giving Battel to the <hi>Galleanguibh,</hi> his own Country-men, at the Fair of <hi>Tailtean.</hi> 3. Again, his immediate Succeſſor <hi>Niall Caille</hi> (who was ſur-named <hi>Caille</hi> from his being drown'd in the River of <hi>Callon;</hi> but drown'd as he was attempting to perform a very chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deed. For being to paſs this River, and ſeeing it high, and therefore having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a young man to try it: and then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this youth preſently in danger, and all others refuſing to hazard themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue him from the violence of the flood; he ſpur'd on his own Horſe to do it himſelf. But
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102628:106"/> it pleas'd God that the bank breaking under the fore-feet of the Horſe, he tumbled down, and ſo was loſt.) This <hi>Niall Caille,</hi> I ſay, Reigning likewiſe 14 years more, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the very mightieſt heat of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Daniſh</hi> War: and therefore (a man would think) having need enough to employ all his power that way; as he did indeed when he gave the <hi>Danes</hi> Battel at <hi>Magh-Ith,</hi> and worſted 'em too: yet withal was ſo unfortunate, as to have (whether juſtly or unjuſtly, I know not) at two ſeveral times during his Reign, and the laſt of them but a little before that Battel, made War on his own Country-men: that is, with a great Army waſted <hi>Leath Cuinn,</hi> firſt from <hi>Biorrha</hi> to <hi>Teambhuir,</hi> and then again <hi>Fercaill</hi> and <hi>Deallbhna Ethra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, I think, by theſe Inſtances of the only three Monarchs that Reign'd while the firſt <hi>Daniſh</hi> War continued, it appears how little Reformation of their bloody Feuds, all the terrors of ſo many mighty Fleets pouring in foreign Enemies continually, had wrought in that People, at leaſt in their Princes, Nobles, and other Men of War. Which undoubtedly we may juſtly think to have been it, or at leaſt a moſt extreamly provoking addition to it, that by this time exaſperated Heaven, and even forc'd the Almighty to pour without further delay the very utmoſt of thoſe evils deſign'd
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102628:106"/> either by his juſtice or mercy to puniſh them. For now, that is, upon the death of <hi>Niall Caille,</hi> in the River of <hi>Callainn,</hi> their Monarchy, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Dominion ceaſed e'en as intirely at home, as it had long before abroad. There was no more Monarch in <hi>Ireland</hi> now; but the ſaddeſt <hi>Interregnum</hi> that ever Chriſtian People had, or Heathen Enemies could wiſh 'em: None, I am ſure, either of the <hi>Mileſian,</hi> or other <hi>Gathelian</hi> Race. No more King henceforth over that People, but that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Heathen <hi>Tungeſius,</hi> who aſſumed that title to himſelf till the days of their bondage which I have before, tho only in part deſcrib'd. No more now the <hi>Iſland of Saints,</hi> nor the <hi>Mart of Literature</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> No more <hi>Beann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuir</hi> to be ſeen, but in Aſhes now a ſecond time, and all the Learned holy Monks thereof Murder'd by thoſe cruel <hi>Danes,</hi> and buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its rubbiſh. No more the Monaſtery of <hi>Fionbhar</hi> at <hi>Corck,</hi> which had 700 Conventual Monks, and together with them 17 Biſhops at one time wholly devoting themſelves to a contemplative life. No more now the moſt wonderful Cloiſter of all for Angelical Viſions and Communications under S. <hi>Mochada,</hi> at <hi>Ratha</hi> firſt, and then at <hi>Liſmore,</hi> containing no fewer hundreds of the moſt ſtupendious Monks for Sanctity that everhave been in any
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102628:107"/> Age or Nation. No more the celebrated Cells of <hi>Magh-Bile,</hi> or any at all of ſo many other holy places ecchoing forth continually the praiſes of God. No more the renowned Schools of <hi>Dun-da-Leathghlaiſs, Ardmagh, Liſmore,</hi> or <hi>Caſhell.</hi> No more Univerſity, nor Academy, nor Colledge of Learning in all the Land: nor Foregners coming to admire and ſtudy in them: nor ſo much as the Natives to enter them, but only to ſtand aloof, and weep over their ruins, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Emperor <hi>Adrians</hi> time.</p>
               <p>This was the deplorable condition of the <hi>Gathelian</hi> off-ſpring in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which the hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous enormity of their no leſs National than peculiar ſins, and among the reſt their ſtrange contempt of ſo many fair warnings from God given them continually from time to time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 300 years, brought them to at laſt, and kept them in until his Juſtice was in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſatisfied. For ſo long he continued the <hi>Interregnum</hi> of their Monarchs, and ſlavery of all their People under that Heathen Tyrant <hi>Turgeſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though I cannot exactly tell, at leaſt be poſitive in it, how many years in all this miſerable condition of theirs laſted, I mean as to the general Bondage of the whole Nation univerſally in every Province and Part: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not certainly know in what year

               <p>27. Beſides, I can inform you, that altho, in regard of the extraordinary mortifications offered, and prayers inceſſantly pour'd out to God by the ſmall remainder of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergy, who had hitherto ſaved themſelves in uncouth horrid Wilderneſſes, he was merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pleas'd, as <hi>Keting</hi> ſays, about this time, <hi>i. e.</hi> after ſome few years of the univerſal Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, to inſpire that counſel to <hi>Maolſeachluinn mhac Mhaolruanuidh,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> King of <hi>Meath,</hi> which as we have related before, deſtroy'd both the Tyrant himſelf, and all his Armies, and Fortifications too on a ſudden, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſet all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation free; being now reſtored every private perſon to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer poſſeſſions, as the Lords and Princes, and Provincial Kings were each of them to his own reſpective juriſdiction at large; and the ſaid <hi>Maolſeachluinn,</hi> by common conſent made Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; and ſo their Policy and power of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion at home fully recovered: Yet ſo were not their Riches, their Treaſures, their Gold, Silver, and Jewels, thoſe former ſpoils of ſo
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102628:109"/> many forreign Provinces, &amp; for ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years gathered home to <hi>Ireland</hi> by their Pagan Predeceſſors. During ſo many ſtrong impreſſions of the late conquering Heathen Foe into the very heart and all the moſt ſecret receſſes of <hi>Ireland,</hi> all were taken by them, and carried away by their ſeveral Fleets, ſome to <hi>Norway,</hi> ſome to <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the reſt to other Eaſtern Borderers on the <hi>German</hi> or <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Sea. And which was a greater loſs to the Learned, their Libraries, their Books were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recover'd. Only the few Religious men that preſerv'd themſelves, preſerved alſo a few of their Books. But the greateſt loſs of all was not only of Learning in the <hi>Mart of Litterature,</hi> but of Sanctity in the <hi>Iſland of Saints.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other was ever at any time after this reſtor'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> at leaſt not near the former degree of eminence. The only thing, the only virtue indeed, that after ſo many great loſſes, revived illuſtriouſly, and continued eminently conſpicuous in that People, was their Military proweſs, their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Bravery, Fortitude in the ſecond <hi>Daniſh</hi> War; to ſay nothing more of their deſtroying <hi>Turgeſius,</hi> and all his Forces, by help of that ſtratagem which ended the firſt. And yet I muſt confeſs that all their Martial ſpirit in that very ſecond War did exert it ſelf in, was only in defending themſelves at home, without any
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102628:109"/> deſign or thought (for ought appears to us) of imitating thoſe former Heroes among their Anceſtors, that carried the terror of their Arms both far and near abroad.</p>
               <p>The truth is, they were no ſooner enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiz'd from the Tyranny of <hi>Turgeſius,</hi> than they reſign'd themſelves wholly to eaſe and reſt, and a life of extream, unworthy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſculin lazineſs. Inſomuch that they not only neglected all kind of Navigation, and proviſion for it: tho they might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the like neglect formerly ſince they became Chriſtians, had been at leaſt one of their greateſt banes, and that which gave their Invaders the opportunity of attacking them without fear on every Quarter of their Iſland, whether with great or ſmall inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Fleets: but were ſo far beſides blinded, that having ſlighted all the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations throughout the Land, they made none at all in their ſtead, nor indeed in any place, not even on the Sea Ports, for their own defence from abroad. And which was yet more ſtrange, would not themſelves be at the trouble of guarding ſo much as any one of all thoſe very Ports, but entertain'd in pay ſome of thoſe very Forreigners (their late vanquiſht enemies) for that employment of greateſt truſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom therefore, that is, from their being hired for pay, they call'd <hi>Buannacidhs.</hi> In a word,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102628:110"/> they gave themſelves over to Luxury and full enjoyment of the good things of the Land; which naturally of it ſelf, without much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, was a Country flowing with Milk and Honey, and all things elſe neceſſary both for life and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But the greateſt of Curſes expecting them was, that by the time (and it was but a very ſhort time when) they had ſurfeired on plenty and wantonneſs, they preſently (ſays <hi>Keting</hi>) return'd to their old vomit again. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd their fatal Feuds, divided, were at cruel diſcord, fell a perſecuting one another like mad, as in former times, with all kind of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility.

That is, the former part of them in the ſeveral Reigns of eight of thoſe eleven Monarchs, that by the unanimous conſent of the Iriſh Annals and Hiſtorians, were undoubtedly ſuch over all <hi>Ireland,</hi> from <hi>Maolſeachluinn</hi> 1. in whoſe Reign the ſecond <hi>Daniſh</hi> War begun, to <hi>Maol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeachluinn</hi> II. being the ſecond time elected or ſubmitted to as the Monarch, ſome few years before this long War ended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the latter part of them likewiſe in the ſeveral Reigns of thoſe other ſix that pretended to be ſuch after this <hi>Maolſeachluinn</hi> II. whereof <hi>Ruaruidh O Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabhar</hi> was the laſt, and conſequently of all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that were any way ſuch. But for ſaving you a labour, I have collected all thoſe inſtances together, and ſo give 'em now: that if you pleaſe, you may read 'em over in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſeries, without interpoſition of any thing elſe. Where, I doubt not, you will admire how notwithſtanding all the heavy preſſures in every Province of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by ſo many power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful foreign Enemies, and ſo many Battels
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102628:111"/> fought, and ſo much blood loſt in the ſame War by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> defending their Countrey againſt thoſe Pagans, they could nevertheleſs have time, and men, and blood to ſpare for ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous a work as the fighting and deſtroying one another ſo cruelly. And yet it ſeems they wanted none of all, not even ſo early as the third Battel fought by them againſt the <hi>Danes</hi> in this very ſecond War.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Maolſeachluinn</hi> I. who had ſo Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly fought the firſt of theſe Battels, being dead in the 16th. year of his Reign; and <hi>Aodh Fionnleath,</hi> who had no leſs bravely fought the ſecond of them, departing this life within or immediatly after the next 16 years: <hi>Flann mhac Sionnadh,</hi> who then ſucceeded in the Monarchy, and Reigned 38 years, gave the fatal beginning to that new ſeries of inteſtine Broils, Depredations, Battels, Slaughters, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, among the Natives themſelves, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd. Certainly the very firſt Act of this Monarch, I mean the firſt recorded of him in his Reign by <hi>Keting,</hi> is that he enter'd in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile manner, Plunder'd, Ranſack'd, Preyd the whole Province of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> and brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Captives and Pledges thence.

Laſtly in this ſecond Reign of <hi>Maolſeachluinn</hi> it was that <hi>Dunn Sleibhe mhac Mhaoilmhorda mhac Muirreigheine</hi> burn'd the King of <hi>Leinſter <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ghaire mhac Tuathail mhac Duinlingine, mhac <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ghaire, mhac Oiliola mhac Duinling,</hi> in his dwelling houſe at <hi>Dubh-Loch Eaſa-Chaille,</hi> even that brave <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ghaire,</hi> that fought the very laſt Battel in <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt the <hi>Danes,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated them ſo mightily that they never after could any where make head againſt the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now both the ſecond War of the the <hi>Danes,</hi> and ſecond reign of <hi>Maolſeachluinn</hi> the II. ending here; I alſo end the former part of my Inſtances. In which, if I be not much deceiv'd, you may obſerve a wilful, obſtinate, furious Nation, maugre all their Chriſtianity, maugre the hand of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo heavy on 'em, proceeding ſtill from worſe to worſe. For in the former <hi>Daniſh</hi> War, notwithſtanding they had moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly tranſgreſſed at ſeveral times, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the edg of their Swords againſt one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; yet all that while none of them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to the impiety of leaguing or joyning with the common barbarous Heathen Foe againſt any Soul whatſoever, or upon any terms at all. But in the later we have ſeen a very great part of 'em do ſo, and do it even
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102628:118"/> all along from the very beginning to the end. At leaſt I am ſure they did ſo full 55 years compleat from time to time, before the Battel of <hi>Clantarff</hi> had broke all the hearts, and hopes, and Leagues together of thoſe that did it. Though after all, the goodneſs of God put off a little further ſtill that heavieſt of his judgments on the Nation in general, which they (whether by relapſing again the third time into their accurſed Feuds, or whether by continuing in 'em at all times, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly at this of their laſt delivery from all forein Enemies) brought on themſelves not only at laſt, but ere very long. And yet I muſt confeſs it was no ſooner than 127 years more were over. For ſo long ſtill, even after the ſecond <hi>Daniſh</hi> War of a hundred and fifty years continuance had been wholly ended by the deſtruction of all their <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Invaders whatſoever, did the wonderful mercy of God to them expect their amendment: certainly a longer period of time than he expected the repentance of the old World, when he had warn'd them to it by the building of the <hi>Ark.</hi> At preſent he was content only to add to the former loſſes of this Nation that which really was the laſt diſpoſition to that heavieſt doom expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: as it was indeed the very laſt ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom of their dying Commonwealth. He
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102628:119"/> removed their Candleſtick; that is, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted their ancient Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The power and majeſty of which, as it had been for ſo many long Ages their only firm prop: ſo it was the only National glory they had left after the deſtruction made (by 200 years continual War with Foreiners) of all whatſoever elſe had been great or illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their Nation. But this is now departed like all the reſt.</p>
               <p>For, after this <hi>Maolſeachluinn</hi> the II. had by death ended his ſecond Reign of nine years continuance, there was never more in <hi>Ireland</hi> any Monarch truly ſuch; never any at all (I mean) univerſally either obey'd, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, or accounted ſuch by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, at leaſt till <hi>Henry</hi> the II. nay, I might ſay, till <hi>James</hi> I. of glorious memory reign'd over 'em. Yet becauſe, I muſt confeſs, there have been ſix more in Title and pretenſion ſuch, that ſucceeded this <hi>Maolſeachluinn,</hi> in their ſeveral periods of time, for a hundred and twenty ſeven years in all: and becauſe the later part of my Inſtances are delivered in their Reigns, I give them alſo now in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
               <p>29. <hi>Donochadh mhac Brien Boraimh</hi> ſucceeded next to <hi>Malſeachluinn</hi> II. for two and fifty years, ſays <hi>Keting,</hi> and was acknowledg'd by <hi>Leath Mogh</hi> and the greater part of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:102628:119"/> In his reign <hi>Art Cuilioch O Ruairck</hi> King of <hi>Breithfne,</hi> violated, ſpoil'd, plunder'd the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of <hi>Cluain Fearta Breanuinn;</hi> but on the ſame day, after he had committed this horrible ſacrilegious villany, was met, and fought, and defeated by the Monarch. In his reign (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſacking of <hi>Waterford</hi> by <hi>Diarmuid Mhaoil-na-mbho</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter;</hi> which I paſs over, becauſe they were, at leaſt moſt of them were <hi>Danes</hi> that lived there at that time) the other famed Sanctuary of <hi>Cluan mhic-Noiſe</hi> was in the like impious manner ſpoil'd by thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> called the <hi>Comhacnuibh;</hi> though ere long ſeverely puniſh'd (ſays <hi>Keting</hi>) by a general mortality ſweeping both themſelves and their Cattel away. In his reign <hi>Carthach mhae Saoirbhreathaigh,</hi> King of <hi>Eoghanachta Casſhell,</hi> and a great many other Gentlemen of Note were burn'd together in a Thatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe by <hi>Mac Longhargain mhac Dunn Chuan.</hi> And after all, this Monarch himſelf, <hi>Dononachadh mhac Brian Boraimh,</hi> was not only depriv'd of his Kingdom, but glad to ſave his life by flying away, and going a poor Pilgrim to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he died in St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Abbey.</p>
               <p>Which in ſhort being the whole account, we find in <hi>Keting,</hi> of what happen'd, to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe here, in the long reign of this <hi>Dononachadh:</hi> what follows now is out of the <note place="margin">

That in the year 1027. which was the next after <hi>Maolſeachluinn</hi>'s death, he prey'd all <hi>Meath, Fingall, Leinſter, Oſſory:</hi> and camp'd for two days near the Walls of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> without any oppoſition. That <hi>An.</hi> 1036. with only one Veſſel he fought, ſunk and took 14 <hi>Breithfne</hi> Ships; and ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd on 'em their plundering of <hi>Cluan Feart.</hi> That in the year 1050, the <hi>Oſſorians</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genians</hi> rebelling, he broke again their Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs: and in the year 1060. having enter ed <hi>Connaght</hi> with a good Army, he compell'd <hi>Ruadhruigh</hi> the King of that Proviuce to give him Hoſtages. So much indeed <hi>Gratianus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> tells us conſequently (in the firſt place) of this <hi>Donochadh mhic Brien Boraimhe.</hi> But then going on he relates (in the next) of <hi>Diarmuid mhic Donochadh,</hi> ſurnam'd <hi>Maol-na-Moa,</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> Nephew to this very <hi>Donochadh O Brian</hi> the <hi>Mounſter</hi> King, by <hi>Dearbhrogil</hi> his Daughter, That, he taking into his care and eſpouſing againſt this Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Uncle the quarrel of young <hi>Toirrghial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach,</hi>

In this year 1048. he ſet upon <hi>Glanuſon,</hi> turn'd it to aſhes, kill'd a hundred of its defenders, and brought away 400 more Captives. In the ſame year he waſted all the <hi>Deſies,</hi> and return'd with an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Cattel and very many Priſoners. In the year 1058. he burnt <hi>Limmerick,</hi> plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>Inis-Ceath,</hi> fought <hi>Donochadh</hi> at the Mountain <hi>Croth,</hi> and routed his whole Army. In the year 1061. he made a miſerable ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Momonians</hi> at <hi>Cuamchoill,</hi> waſted their Countrey, and put all both Houſes, Stacks, and ſtanding Corn into a light flame of fire. <hi>Anno</hi> 1063. he burnt <hi>Limmerick</hi> the ſecond time, forc'd the <hi>Momonians</hi> to give him Hoſtages out of all parts of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; nay ſoon after upon a new rebellion or inſurrection of theirs plagued them again and compell'd 'em to new ſubmiſſions and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages; which Hoſtages he delivered all every one to the foreſaid <hi>Toirrghiallach.</hi> The next year, which was 1064. he beat <hi>Donochadh</hi> out of all his Kingdom, made him fly beyond
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102628:121"/> Seas, plac'd <hi>Tourrghiallach</hi> in his Throne, at leaſt of <hi>Mounſter:</hi> and in the following 1065. upon intelligence of <hi>Donochadh</hi>'s ſon <hi>Murchadh</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s ſetting up for himſelf, he march'd the laſt time into <hi>Mounſter,</hi> ſuppreſſed that Inſurrection, chas'd <hi>Murchadh</hi> into <hi>Connaght,</hi> receiv'd the third time Hoſtages from all <hi>Mounſter,</hi> and, as he had done before, put them into the hands of <hi>Tourrghiallach</hi> now King after his Uncle. Moreover this Author writes of the ſame <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muid</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter;</hi> that, beſides his pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down and ſetting up ſo whom he pleaſed in that Province of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> he made <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght</hi> alſo yield, having marcht into it with a ſmart Army, harraſs'd it, and reduced <hi>Aodh O Conchabhar,</hi> the King of it, to ſuch ſtreights, that in the year 1061. he was e'en forc'd at laſt to buy his peace by coming to his Houſe in <hi>Leinſter</hi> and ſubmitting to his pleaſure. That before this, in the year 1048. at three ſeveral times he waſted <hi>Meath</hi> ſo cruelly, ſo without any diſcrimination or diſtinction made 'twixt ſacred and profane, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd with fire even moſt of the very Churches there: and in the year 1053. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring it the fourth time, he led away both a very great number of Captives, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable preys. That for the <hi>Danes</hi> or <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterlings</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who (it ſeems) ſtood upon terms of Conteſt with him, he in the year
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102628:121"/> 1052. plagued them ſo mightily by burning not only <hi>Fingall,</hi> but all other Territories round about them on every ſide, and then fighting and worſting and ſlaughtering a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them hard by their own Walls, that they were glad at laſt to proclaim him their King alſo, and wholly ſubmit to his will. That notwithſtanding all his former Victories, he was in the year of Chriſt 1072, on the 17th of <hi>February,</hi> being <hi>Tueſday,</hi> fought, defeated, kill'd in the Battel of <hi>Odhbhen</hi> by <hi>Conchabhar O Maolſeachluinn</hi> King of <hi>Meath.</hi> And laſtly this Author tells us, That among all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Antiquaries only <hi>Keting</hi> places <hi>Donochadh O Brien,</hi> only Sir <hi>James Ware, Diarmuid mhac Mhaoil-na-Moa</hi> in the Catalogue of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs. So that all the reſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it ſeems, account neither of them, and conſequently none at all in their days to have been King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but hold a meer <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum</hi> then of the Monarchy. But be it ſo, or no, it matters not to my purpoſe; being the Inſtances brought all along in that very long Reign of <hi>Donochadh,</hi> at leaſt over <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> are true; whether <hi>Donochadh</hi> or <hi>Diarmuid,</hi> or any other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prince in their time was more than a Provincial King, or leſs than a Monarch of the whole Iſland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Toirrghiallach mhae Teidhg, mhic Brien Boraimb</hi> (that is in our Language, <hi>Terence,</hi> the Son
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102628:122"/> of <hi>Teig,</hi> the Son of <hi>Brien Boraimh</hi>) is now Succeſſor to <hi>Donachadh,</hi> as in the Kingdom of <hi>Mounſter</hi> and <hi>Leath mogh,</hi> ſo in the Title of Monarch, ſays <hi>Keting.</hi> Nor do I find that any other oppoſed this Title of his. But one reaſon hereof might be his ruling peaceably, troubling no man, nor forcing any thing from either Province or man, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they took no exception againſt the Title whether aſſum'd by himſelf or given him by others during his ſhort Reign, which was but of twelve years only, as moſt Antiquaries ſay; though ſome extend it to 22 years: the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their difference being, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer count the beginning of his Reign from the death of <hi>Diarmuid Mhaoil-na-moa</hi> in the Battel of <hi>Odhbhen;</hi> the later take it from the death of <hi>Donochadh O Brien</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> or at leaſt from his depoſition and flight. However, this is unanimouſly confeſs'd, that as he lived quietly for his own part during his Reign, ſo he died naturally in the 77 year of his Age, being the year of Chriſt 1086. But ſo did not under his Reign <hi>Conchabhor O Maolſeachluinn</hi> King of <hi>Meath</hi> For this but lately Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince was treacherouſly murthered by his own Nephew <hi>Murcho' mhac Floinn:</hi> and his head, after burial of it at <hi>Cluain-mhac-Noiſe,</hi> carried to the Monarch then reſiding at <hi>Coann-Chora.</hi> Who deſired to ſee it, becauſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102628:122"/> he bore this <hi>Methian</hi> King no good will, for having kill'd (though in Battel) his dear Couſin, his Patron, his ſupporter and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector <hi>Diarmuid mhac Donochadh,</hi> ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Maol-na-moa,</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> as we have ſeen before. But his curioſity coſt him dear. For the head being brought him on <hi>good Friday;</hi> as he was viewing it, a little Mouſe ſlipt out of it into his Boſom, which ſo affrighted him, eſpecially when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how next <hi>Sunday</hi> the ſame head was miraculouſly return'd back to <hi>Cluain-mhac-Noiſe</hi> with a gold Ring upon it, that he fell preſently into a languiſhing Diſeaſe, that held him after in cruel pain for ſeveral years, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was perfectly over till he died. So writes the Author of <hi>Cambrenſis Euerſus.</hi> And now</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muirchiortach mhac Toirrghialbhaigh mhac Teaidhg,</hi> the great Grandchild of <hi>Brien Boraimh,</hi> and Son to the foreſaid <hi>Toirrgheallach,</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Father in the Sovereignty at leaſt of <hi>Mounſter, Leath Mogh,</hi> and greater part of <hi>Ireland</hi> for 20 years, ſays <hi>Keting.</hi> In which Reign, though he record nothing proper to our purpoſe in this place (and ſomewhat extraordinary that very ſame is) yet <hi>Gratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Lucius</hi> has enough. This Author, <hi>page</hi> 82. and 84. gives a very particular account of the great combuſtions in it. He tells us how upon the death of <hi>Toirrghiallach O Brien</hi> the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102628:123"/> laſt Monarch, not only this <hi>Muirchiortach</hi> his Son, but <hi>Domhnall,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ardghar,</hi> the Son of <hi>Lochlen,</hi> King of <hi>Tir-Conel</hi> contended to ſome purpoſe for the Sovereignty of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> How the former by fight and ſpoil ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the <hi>Lagenians,</hi> and the later in the ſame manner the <hi>Methians.</hi> How <hi>Dombnal</hi> had in the year 1088. got the ſtart of <hi>Muirchiortach</hi> by forcing the King and Kingdom of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght</hi> to give him Hoſtages for their future fidelity: and then immediatly enter'd <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> burnt <hi>Limmerick,</hi> demoliſh'd <hi>Ceann-Chora</hi> the chief Royal Seat ever ſince <hi>Brien Boraimh</hi>'s time, waſted the whole Countrey thereabouts with Fire and Sword, and brought away thence beſides an infinite number of Horſes and all ſorts of Cattel, vaſt Treaſures of Gold, Silver and Plate.

Columbae</hi> that without queſtion that <hi>Dear-mach</hi> (in Latin <hi>Roboretum</hi> or <hi>Campus Roborum,</hi> for <hi>Dair</hi> or <hi>Doir</hi> ſignifies an Oak in the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and <hi>Mach</hi> or <hi>Magh</hi> a Field) which <hi>Beda</hi> meant, was at the place ever ſince called by the Iriſh <hi>Doire Columb-Cille,</hi> as it is of late by the Engliſh <hi>London-derry,</hi> and by no means at <hi>Ardmagh.</hi> But to paſs over as well that errour of my own, as the brief account, immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this reflection on it, given of the pious end thoſe two great Contenders made: for peradventure you will ſay, and I confeſs it freely, that neither the one nor the other is to my main purpoſe here: and therefore to return, and proſecute only that which is my Province: I will now let you ſee all the glory of the Monarchical (or at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Monarchical) Power of <hi>Ireland</hi> (which never laſted long, not even from <hi>Heber</hi>'s days,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102628:125"/> in any one Family or Sept) removing from <hi>Mounſter</hi> to <hi>Cannaght;</hi> and from the <hi>O Brians</hi> there to the <hi>O Connors</hi> here. Yet leaving ſtill, for my part, the Queſtion undetermined, whether the ſame Monarchy did not continue for two years longer in <hi>Tirconel,</hi> after it had ended in <hi>Tomond,</hi> and ſo paſs'd immediatly not from <hi>Muirchiortach O Brian,</hi> but from <hi>Dombnall mhac Ardghar mhac Loghlin.</hi> However, that was,</p>

The ſecond time he invaded it both by Land and Sea: himſelf marching by Land in the

               <p>Such is the account of this Monarch, and no more, I mean, of his Warlike Actions and Exploits, delivered by <hi>Keting,</hi> in his Reign. But <hi>Gratianus Lucius,</hi> in his <hi>Cambrenſis Euerſus</hi> ſays further of him, that he prey'd all the Provinces of <hi>Ireland,</hi> every one. That he made his own Son <hi>Conchabhar</hi> actually and really King of the <hi>Dublinians, Lagenians</hi> and <hi>Methians.</hi> That with his Land Army he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd <hi>Tirconel,</hi> and with his Navy conſiſting of 190 Ships waſted <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> and with both reduced both theſe warlike Countreys of the <hi>North.</hi> That nevertheleſs, before the end of his Reign, his Glory was obſcur'd and power humbled by him who came next to ſucceed in the Monarchy, and who begun early (it ſeems) to lay the foundation of his own fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture greatneſs by making War on this very <hi>Toirrghiallach mor O Conchabhar</hi> himſelf, the

Though (ſays <hi>Gratianus</hi>) according to a more exact ſevere diſcuſſion of the truth, if the date of his Monarchy be taken from the death of his Predeceſſor <hi>Mairchiortach O Brien</hi> to his own, he muſt have reigned over <hi>Ireland</hi> 34 years in all: or at leaſt 28, if it be continued only till the foreſaid Hoſtages were forc'd from him.

For this Author <hi>p.</hi> 86. ſays of the preſent <hi>Muir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiartach,</hi> firſt in general, That his humour having been wholly Martial, and his fortune anſwerable, he over-run all the Provinces of <hi>Ireland</hi> in a continual courſe of Victories, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained partly by Battels, and partly by the ſole terrour of his Name. That he ſubdued them all, and forced them every one to give him Hoſtages. That therefore at leaſt He, without any contradiction, may be admitted next after <hi>Maolſeachluinn</hi> II. for the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King of all <hi>Ireland.</hi> And then, after let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us know that this Prince's great Vertues were much eclipſed by the Precipitancy of his anger: and that whom proſperity had rais'd to ſuch a heighth, adverſity at laſt did throw down as low even to the very earth: he particularly recounts how <hi>Eochadh</hi> King of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> not only refus'd to pay any more Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute or other dues to him, but even without any other provocation made War upon him.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102628:127"/> That he being thereupon enraged enters the Territories of <hi>Eochadh,</hi> routs his Forces, burns his Lands, takes his Vaſſals, and puts them in Fetters; <hi>Eochadh</hi> himſelf by good luck eſcaping. That after this, yea notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reconciliation made between them by the interceſſion, and upon the Engagement of the Primat of <hi>Ardmagh</hi> and <hi>Donochadh</hi> King of <hi>Oirghllae</hi> for performance of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants on both ſides, and <hi>Eochadh</hi>'s conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential pardon and reception to grace; which to aſſure him <hi>Muirchiortach</hi> took the moſt ſolemn Oath he could (for ſuch it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted then in that Kingdom) on the <hi>Staff of Jeſus</hi> (what this was, S. <hi>Bernard</hi> tells in the Life of <hi>Malachias:</hi>) yet ere long, whether out of the former cauſe, or any other new one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging him, he had <hi>Eochadh</hi>'s eyes pull'd out of his head: and three of his Nobles (<hi>duos Olingſios, &amp; Cathaſachi O Flahry nepotem</hi>) moſt cruelly put to death; without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the engagement of the Sureties. And, to conclude, that <hi>Donochadh O Cearrbhaoil</hi> the foreſaid King of <hi>Oirghillae,</hi> one of the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, taking to heart ſo heinous a breach of Faith, Oath, Covenants, and aſſurance given by himſelf; and therefore reſolving to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd, draws to his aſſociation the People of <hi>Vibhruinne</hi> and <hi>Comhaicne;</hi> marches with an Army of 9000 men into <hi>Cineal-Eoghain</hi> (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102628:128"/> call'd by them <hi>Tir-Eoghain,</hi> but by us <hi>Tir-oen</hi>) where the Monarch then reſided; ſurprizes him unprovided; fights the few tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary Forces led forth by him, routs them, and kills him in that Field, a man ever before Victorious in all his Encounters whatſoever. Yet ſuch was his end in the 10th of his reign, <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1166, ſays <hi>Gratianus Lucius;</hi> though <hi>Keting</hi> ſays he was kill'd in the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of his Reign, by <hi>Fearrnibh Fearr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mhaighe</hi> and <hi>O Brien,</hi> as I have noted before. But as their difference in computing the years of the Reign is not material; the one begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it when this <hi>Muirchiortach mhac Neill</hi> had forc'd his predeceſſor <hi>Toirrghiallach mor O Conchabhar</hi> to give him Hoſtages, and the other when <hi>Toirrghiallach</hi> died: ſo neither is it material to know whether any ſuch perſons call'd <hi>Fearrnibh Fearrmhaighe</hi> and <hi>O Brien</hi> were, or were not in that Battel to kill him. What is to our preſent purpoſe, you have it very particularly delivered by the one, and not gainſaid by the other.</p>
               <p>And yet upon reflection I muſt confeſs I find that I have not delivered all the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial things written by <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> in this Reign of <hi>Muirchiortach mhac Neill.</hi> He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writes (<hi>page</hi> 87.) that in the Year 1156. even the very firſt year of it, preſently after <hi>Toirrghiallach mor O Conchabhar</hi>'s death,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102628:128"/> his Son and Heir and King of <hi>Connaght Ruidh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruigh O Conchabhar</hi> did receive twelve Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from <hi>Muirchiortach O Brien;</hi> even that very <hi>Mounſter</hi> King ſo lately before deprived and baniſh'd to <hi>Tir-Eoghain</hi> by the ſaid <hi>Toirrghial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach</hi> (Father to this <hi>Ruidhruigh</hi>) as we have ſeen already. That in the Year 1157. he ruſh'd into <hi>Muirchiortach mhac Neill</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's own peculiar Countrey <hi>Tir-Eoghain,</hi> burnt the fruitful <hi>Peninſula</hi> there, call'd <hi>Inis-Eoghain,</hi> deſtroy'd all the delicate Gardens, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, Plantations; waſted the whole Region to <hi>Cianachty.</hi> That after this he turn'd his Arms on <hi>Mounſter;</hi> Where having firſt ſetled the foreſaid <hi>Muirchiortach O Brien</hi> in poſſeſſion of North-<hi>Mounſter,</hi> he forc'd Hoſtages from <hi>Diarmuid mhac Cormuic mhic Cartha</hi> King of South-<hi>Mounſter,</hi> to remain with him till <hi>Muir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiortach mhac Neill</hi> the Monarch did relieve the ſaid <hi>Diarmuid.</hi> That <hi>Anno</hi> 1158. he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd <hi>Leinſter</hi> in like hoſtile manner with great Force: marcht through it to <hi>Leiglin:</hi> being encamp'd there had Hoſtages brought him from <hi>Oſſory</hi> and <hi>Luighis:</hi> and, in the cloſe of all, loaded <hi>Mac Craih O Morrdha</hi> the little King of <hi>Luighis</hi> with Irons. That in the next place he made Inroads into <hi>Teabhan,</hi> driving away thence from the <hi>Kerins</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great prey of Cows: and with his Fleet afflicted all the Coaſts of <hi>Tir-Eoghain</hi> mightily.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102628:129"/> That in the Year 1161. falling violently on <hi>Meath,</hi> he both compelled the Countreys call'd <hi>Vibh Falain</hi> and <hi>Vibh Faoilghe</hi> to give him pledges, and then plac'd Governours in them, <hi>viz. Faolan O Faoelain</hi> in the one, and <hi>Mlaghlin O Conchabhair</hi> in the other. That after all, he made his Conditions of peace with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, deliver'd him four Hoſtages; receiv'd from him in gift the entire Province of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght,</hi> with the one half of <hi>Meath,</hi> and from <hi>Diarmuid O Maolſeachluinn</hi> a hundred ounces of Gold for that half. So that by this time, I think the Reader has no reaſon to complain of want of Inſtances to purpoſe out of this Reign of <hi>Muirchiortach mhac Neill:</hi> Who, as we have ſeen, was the ſaddeſt of them all himſelf, as having by his own Vaſſals been ſet upon unprovided, fought, overcome, and kill'd,.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place <hi>Ruaruidh O Conchabhar</hi> King of <hi>Connaght,</hi> e'n that very ſame <hi>Rua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruidh,</hi> who contended for ſo many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with <hi>Muirchiortach mhac Neill,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him at laſt, appears now his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor on this long tottering Theatre of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchs. <hi>Keting</hi> delivers a very imperfect account of him, ſaying, That beſides <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght</hi> he had only the Kings of <hi>Breithfne</hi> and <hi>Oirghillac</hi> to acknowledg his Sovereignty; and giving ſcarce any thing elſe happen'd in his Reign, but what relates to <hi>Diarmuid na Ngall</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:102628:129"/> the <hi>Leinſter</hi> Kings Rape, and to the <hi>Brittons</hi> invited in by this <hi>Diarmuid;</hi> nothing I am ſure of thoſe warlike Actions and great Conteſts of this Monarch with other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Princes. But this defect in <hi>Keting</hi> is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where abundantly ſupply'd, I mean by <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus Lucius</hi> in his <hi>Cambrenſis Everſus.</hi> In this Author, grounding himſelf on the Annals of <hi>Inis Faile,</hi> you may read that this <hi>Ruaruidh</hi> not only bore the Title of King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but was ſo indeed. But, without any perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the Relation given by him, ſhews this laſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarch's fatal Reign to have been fruitful enough of thoſe (and they the very laſt of thoſe) Inſtances I purpos'd to recount.</p>
               <p>Immediately on the death of his Predeceſſor (kill'd by <hi>Eochadh</hi>) he march'd his <hi>Connaght</hi> Army to <hi>Aſſa Ruah,</hi> ſubdued all <hi>Tirconel,</hi> and received their Hoſtages. From thence both with his own <hi>Connacians,</hi> and the Legions of <hi>Breithfne, Teamhfna,</hi> and <hi>Meath,</hi> led on by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghernan O Ruairk</hi> King of <hi>Breithfne</hi> and <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muid O Maolſeachluinn</hi> King of <hi>Meath,</hi> he march'd to <hi>Dublin,</hi> enter'd it, was entertain'd in it by the <hi>Danes, Eaſterlings,</hi> and other the Inhabitants of that City and Territories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, with all demonſtrations of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: was proclaim'd their King: and they preſented by him according to the cuſtom then with a royal Gift of 4000 Beeves. From
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102628:130"/> hence, but joyning firſt all the Militia of thoſe Citizens to his former Legions, he goes directly ſo accompanied to <hi>Droghedagh</hi> (the <hi>Iriſh</hi> call it <hi>Droighid Ath</hi>) is received there by <hi>Donochad O Cearbheoil</hi> King of <hi>Oirghiallae,</hi> has Hoſtages whom he pleas'd of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey put into his power, and then cauſes a preſent of 2000 Beeves more to be in his name given that King. From thence return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to <hi>Leinſter,</hi> he advances to <hi>Findorf,</hi> gives Battel there to <hi>Mac Murcho</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> defcats him, purſues him, forces him at laſt to ſubmit and give Hoſtages, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges him of his juriſdiction, leaves him only <hi>Cionſallach,</hi> and bids him be content with that, or he ſhould loſe that too. From thence he made his progreſs to <hi>Mac Gille Phadruic,</hi> the King of <hi>Oſſory;</hi> who delivering Pledges was royally treated and preſented by him. And now he enters <hi>Mounſter;</hi> has the ſubmiſſions of all the Province: beſtows <hi>North-Mounſter</hi> on <hi>Muirchiortach O Brien,</hi> his own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a Mother: commands pledges from <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armuid mhac Cartha</hi> King of <hi>South-mounſter:</hi> and ſo paſſes on in triumph to <hi>Connaght</hi> his own home, having well nigh ſurrounded the whole Iſland in this very firſt year of his Reign. After which circuit (and either in the ſame year of our Lord 1166, as <hi>Gratianus</hi> inſinuates it to have been: or, at furtheſt in the next, as the Annals of <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>Cambden</hi> expreſly ſay) it
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102628:130"/> was, that <hi>Diamuid mhac Mhurrchadh,</hi> (alias <hi>Mhurchu,</hi> and <hi>Diarmuid na Nghall</hi>) having committed the famous Rape (if it was a Rape) on <hi>Tighernan O Roirk</hi> King of <hi>Breithfn</hi>'s Wife, the ſame <hi>Tighernan</hi> to be reveng'd on <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muid,</hi> by the Monarch's Authority head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both his own <hi>Breithne</hi> Forces with thoſe of <hi>Meath,</hi> and moſt of <hi>Leinſter</hi> too, march'd into <hi>Ibh-Cionſallach;</hi> made <hi>Diarmuid</hi> fly beyond Seas; deſtroy'd his Caſtle at <hi>Ferns;</hi> divided his ſaid Countrey of <hi>Cionſallach</hi> between <hi>Mac Gille Phadrick</hi> King of <hi>Oſſory</hi> and one <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadh</hi> the Son of <hi>Murchadh;</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with ſeventeen Hoſtages for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. And now this revenge or juſtice on <hi>Diarmuid</hi> being executed, the Monarch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>An.</hi> 1167. attended on by all the Kings and Nobles of <hi>Mounſter, Leinſter, Meath, Breithſne, Comhaicne, Orghiall,</hi> and <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lla</hi> (which I take to have been then but a part of the now large Province of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi>) with all their Troops, conſiſting of Nine and thirty thouſand Foot, and one and twenty thouſand Horſe, march'd to <hi>Ardmach.</hi> From thence, of one ſide with thoſe great Land Forces, and from <hi>Doire</hi> (now by us call'd <hi>London-derry</hi>) on the other, where his Fleet of a hundred and ninety Sail had landed, he attacks <hi>Tir-Eoghain</hi> ſo furiouſly on every ſide, that after the ſtubborn Forces of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102628:131"/> being firſt retired into their Woody Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, had not only in vain attempted to fall by Night on his Royal Camp, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof by a great miſtake had fallen fouly on one another in the dark, they found it neceſſary on the fourth day to ſubmit and deliver him Hoſtages.

In the Year 1177. one of his own Sons, by name <hi>Murchadh,</hi> out of ſome unreaſonable pique turn'd moſt unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Traytor to him: ſided with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy: and was the very Guide to <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> and his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops in their entring <hi>Connaght,</hi> or at leaſt from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Roſcommon</hi> till they were ſoon after fought, and beat, and forc'd back out of that whole Province by <hi>Ruaruidh</hi> himſelf. Who thereupon ſeiz'd the ſaid <hi>Murchadh;</hi> and though his own Son put out his eyes for his rebellious unnatural Treachery (and juſtly enough without any peradventure:) as at the ſame time, for ſome other heinous tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he confin'd priſoner to the ſmall Iſland in <hi>Loch-Cuam</hi> his own other (yea his eldeſt) Son <hi>Conchabhar;</hi> whom notwithſtanding <hi>O Flatherty</hi> and other Favourers of this young Prince, reſcued by plain force within a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month from that reſtraint, and ſet at liberty. To conclude, partly the forein Invaders, but chiefly his own Children brought this laſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarch's hoary hairs with grief to the Grave. Even his own eldeſt Son, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Conchabhar</hi> in the year 1186. firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd him of his very Kingdom of <hi>Connaght:</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:102628:133"/> then by ſundry other indignities forc'd him to fly away to <hi>Mounſter:</hi> and laſt of all, after he had been recall'd by the <hi>Connaght</hi> Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, compell'd him again to ſeek refuge in <hi>Tir-Chonaill.</hi> And here it was that this now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted man indeed, though in his youth and manly years too for ſome time the Darling of Fortune, found his long wiſh'd-for death among the <hi>Chanon Regulars</hi> in the Year of Chriſt 1198. having firſt by habit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion made himſelf a member of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Order. He continued ſeventeen years poſſeſs'd, at leaſt in part and in Title, of his Monarchy over the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> For ſo many years their Antiquaries allow his Reign over <hi>Ireland:</hi> though from the beginning of it to his death, were efflux'd full two and forty years.</p>
               <p>Thus you have in ſubſtance the account (and a very particular full one indeed it is) given by <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> of this very laſt <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſian</hi> Monarch and his Reign over <hi>Ireland.</hi> Wherein, if I be not extreamly miſtaken, you have withal (though among other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which I have for ſome uſe that may be made of them hereafter mentioned) Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces enough anſwerable both in quality and number to thoſe alledged before out of any of the former Reigns of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchs ſince <hi>Maolſeachluinn</hi> II. for demonſtrating what I intended by them all. Certainly theſe and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102628:134"/> thoſe jointly taken are ſufficient demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the Monarchs, Princes and other great ones of that Nation <hi>receiv'd no corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> from the great Hand that from above ſcourg'd them ſo grievouſly, ſo often, and ſo long. Nor can it be denied, that the later part of the ſame Inſtances, (I mean that large part of them which hap'ned between <hi>Maol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeachluinn</hi> II. Reign, and <hi>Ruadhruigh O Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabhair</hi>'s <hi>death</hi>) are moſt evident convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the little, nay the evil uſe, in order to any reformation of their fatal Feuds, they made of the hundred and thirty years free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from foreign Enemies after the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion or ſubjection of the <hi>Danes;</hi> though a large term of time queſtionleſs allow'd them by the extraordinary mercy of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, at leaſt then, more wiſely of the matter, and not only relent from their former unnatural courſes of perſecuting and ſpoiling, and killing, and murdering one another, but heartily repent what themſelves and their Parents and their Grandſires had done in that kind, exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him continually to haſten on 'em that final doom of theirs which he had ſo long ſuſpended. Neither is it any further to be doubted, that both the former and later part equally of the ſame Inſtances are ſufficient proofs that thoſe paſſages of <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, which I have given before, (<hi>page</hi> 153.)
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:102628:134"/> however in his time, and as ſpoken by him, deſcribing only the ſtubbornneſs of his own <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Countrymen, might nevertheleſs be moſt juſtly applied by <hi>Keting</hi> (the pious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecter on theſe matters) to the <hi>Mileſian</hi> race in <hi>Ireland</hi> at this time of theirs, after that nothing at all, neither adverſity nor proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor war nor peace, nor bondage nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty could reclaim them. Verily to me thoſe Inſtances are more than ſufficient proofs, That this wilful Generation of Chriſtians did at this time in the language of the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>harden their faces harder than a Rock,</hi> and, e'en <hi>refuſe to return.</hi> Nay whatever any body elſe may think, certainly it ſeems further to me, that ſuch was the Judgment God himſelf gave of them. For (if I may be allowed once more to ſpeak my ſenſe in a ſymbolical or Metaphorical Scripture phraſe, and apply to them what another Prophet ſaid many Ages before on another Subject and of another Kingdom, but is applicable enough to them) at this very time, <hi>The Watchman and holy one from Heaven</hi> (Dan. 4.) pronounced the long ſuſpended Sentence, the fatal Decree, the final Doom, here on Earth, againſt this lofty-headed large-ſpread Tree of the <hi>Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Stock in <hi>Ireland.</hi> At this time he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded this Eternal Decree to be forthwith put in execution. At this time he call'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102628:135"/> the new Miniſters of his Wrath, and bid 'em to <hi>cut down this Tree, chop off its boughs, ſhake off all its leaves, diſperſe its fruit, make the beaſts fly that were under it, and the birds of the air from perching any more on its branches;</hi> though withal bidding them to <hi>leave the ſpring of the roots thereof ſtill in the ground.</hi> And I am ſure, that to ſpeak plain without Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or Metaphor, what happened ſince the ſixth year of <hi>Ruadhruigh O Conchabhar</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Reign hath manifeſtly ſhewn that from thence, <hi>i. e.</hi> from that year, which was of Chriſt's Incarnation 1172. We muſt date the laſt and heavieſt doom of Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt that People as to their Being in this World; Never more to have a King or State of their own; Never more to be a Free People on Earth, ſo as not to be under a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Yoke. And I believe you will think the ſame when you conſider that ſince that <hi>Epocha</hi> or Date they and their poſterity after them have already ſeen five hundred Years and Eight of this their heavy Doom continued. Tho after all, upon after-thoughts, I think it more wiſe to ſuſpend than be poſitive in any judgment of the future; eſpecially conſidering the example of <hi>Spain,</hi> recovered after ſeven hundred years ſubjection to the <hi>Moors.</hi>

The truth is, I mean'd only to ſay, That in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their long duration &amp; perpetual return from time to time for almoſt five and twenty hundred years compleat, and their exceſſive degree at very many times within that long Succeſſion of Ages, eſpecially conſidering the ſmall extent of <hi>Ireland,</hi> thoſe cruel bloody Feuds were both National and peculiar to that People only. Which, I think, is true,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102628:139"/> notwithſtanding that other Nations, either much greater, or much leſſer, might have been in ſome few Inſtances of time as high, nay peradventure much more horrible tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors in the very ſame kind than thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Mileſians</hi> were at any one time ſince their Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> from <hi>Tuath-Dee-Danan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>33. The ſecond point is, to do thoſe ancient <hi>Mileſians</hi> the right, as to acknowledg (what their Hiſtories have at large) That amidſt all the Feuds and fury of their Arms, how bloody or how laſting ſoever, they had ſeveral both Monarchs, and (after the Pentarchy was ſet up) leſſer Kings, yea ſome of thoſe too in their time of Paganiſm, and many more as well of thoſe as theſe after Chriſtianity eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, that were of great renown among them for other excellent Qualifications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their dignity, than thoſe only of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Vertue and Fortitude.</p>
               <p>In time of Paganiſm, they had their (XXII) Monarch <hi>Ollamh Fodhla,</hi> ſo called from his great Knowledg: that very name given him importing in <hi>Iriſh</hi> (as <hi>Gratianus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> hath obſerv'd) a great maſter in Sciences, and Teacher of all Knowledg to his People. It was he that divided the Lands of <hi>Ireland</hi> into Hundreds, call'd by them <hi>Triochae-chead;</hi> and placed a Lord over each Hundred, and over each Town of the Hundred a Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102628:140"/> an Applotter of Duties, and receiver of Strangers, to provide Entertainment for them. They had their (XCI) Monarch <hi>Conair mor mhac Eidirſgceoil,</hi> ſo great a Juſticiar, ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a Proſecutor of all Malefactors, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with great pains, induſtry, hazard to himſelf; yet he forc'd at laſt all kind of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Thieves, Vagabonds and Idlers to fly the whole Kingdom: and after this, during his Reign, the Cattel throughout all parts and Provinces wandred ſafely in the Fields with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Keeper. Beſides, the magnificent Hoſpitality of this Monarch is wonderfully celebrated in that Nation. Add hereunto this farther happineſs of his Reign, That in it the weather was ſo mild from mid-harveſt to mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, that both Kine and Sheep and other Beaſts lay continually abroad in the open air without feeling one ſharp breath of wind; the Sea covered the very ſhores at <hi>Imbher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholptha</hi> (then ſo called; after <hi>Droichid ath;</hi> by us now corruptly <hi>Droghedae</hi> or <hi>Tredath</hi>) with a moſt prodigious ejection of all ſorts of Fiſh: and the fruit-bearing Trees were ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that they hung down their branches to the very earth.</p>
               <p>They had their (CIV) Monarch <hi>Conn,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Ceadchatach,</hi> whoſe Reign, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that prodigious number of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels ſought by him, as we have ſeen before,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102628:140"/> was ſo wonderfully abounding in all earthly bleſſings throughout <hi>Ireland,</hi> that when the Writers of after-Ages were minded to expreſs any time of extraordinary abundance or plenty, they ſaid it was the Reign of <hi>Conn Ceadchatach,</hi> or <hi>Conair Mor,</hi> return'd again on Earth. Now doubtleſs, it could not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than morally impoſſible, that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering all his Battels, there ſhould be ſo much plenty in every part of the Kingdom, had not he, as well as <hi>Conair Mor</hi> before him, been as good a Governour as he was a great Warrior. And yet, on this occaſion, let me tell you, that neither the one nor other excellency could ſave him from being murther'd. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, becauſe of the extraordinary contrivance and manner of it, I take that notice here, which I find in <hi>Gratianus Lucius;</hi> though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it may ſeem forein to this place; and <hi>Keting</hi> has not a ſyllable how, or where, or whether at all this Monarch died either of a natural or violent death, But thus in ſhort it happen'd.

               <p>They had their (CII) Monarch <hi>Felim</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Rachtmhor</hi> from his being a Great Maker of excellent wholſome Laws, Among which he eſtabliſh'd with all firmneſs that of <hi>Retaliation:</hi> kept to it moſt inviolably; and by that means preſerv'd the people in peace, quiet, plenty, and ſecurity during his Time.</p>
               <p>They had their (CIX) Monarch <hi>Cormock mhac Airt,</hi> who (ſays <hi>Lucius</hi>) in making good Laws for the Commonwealth, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them, exceeded by much all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors.

Add further yet, as part of this heavy <hi>Leinſter</hi> Fine, ſays <hi>Lucius,</hi> 30 either white or red Cows, with their Calves of the ſame colour; 30 braſs Collars for thoſe Cows to keep them quiet in their ſtabling, and 30 other brazen ties for their feet alſo to keep them gentle at their milking. Where nevertheleſs I muſt take notice, that <hi>Lucius</hi> in this Account does much vary from <hi>Keting:</hi> and that, whatever may be thought
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102628:143"/> of all other particulars of it, ſurely the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 15000 Cauldrons (or Coppers, as we call them now) of that capacity, ſeems to me ſomewhat incredible. But leaving this to the Readers indifferency: what is more proper here may be read in the ſame Author <hi>Lucius,</hi> where he tells us next of this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs port and magnificence in Houſe-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which, though very great indeed, is however (I think) credible enough. He had eleven hundred and fifty Waiters that ſerv'd him ordinarily at Table in his great Hall at <hi>Tarach.</hi> And this Hall was by himſelf built of purpoſe to anſwer in its capacity the entertainment and attendance of a great King. It was 300 Foot long, 30 Cubits high, and 50 Cubits broad, with fourteen Doors opening into it. And the daily ſervice of Plate, the Flagous and Cups of Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and precious ſtone, at his Table there, conſiſted of a hundred and fifty pieces in all.</p>
               <p>What is beſides delivered of this Monarch is, That (which among the truly wiſe muſt be more valuable than any worldly magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence or ſecular glory whatſoever.) He was to all mankind very juſt: and in his later days through the mercy of God, very pious alſo &amp; religious towards him. That ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powerful on a ſudden were his inward
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102628:143"/> illuminations, That in plain terms he now refus'd his Druids any more to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their Idol Gods. That ſoon after he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly profeſſed he would no more worſhip any but the only true God of the Univerſe, the <hi>Immortal and Inviſible King of Ages,</hi> as the great Apoſtle calls him. And finally that thoſe Prieſts of the Devil, by their Necromantical adjurations and miniſtery of damned Spirits raiſed from Hell, God permitting it, wrought his deſtruction by choaking him, as I have ſaid before. For in ſuch manner and for ſuch a cauſe died this great and happy King of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, An. Chriſti</hi> 266. But whether he may, or may not therefore, be rank'd among the true Chriſtian Martyrs? I leave others to judge.</p>
               <p>And the ſame queſtion might peradventure be rationally put (though not, I confeſs, with the ſame advantage of the circumſtance of violence from an external cauſe) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Connor</hi> the firſt Provincial King of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> made by the Monarch <hi>Eochuidh Fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioch</hi> himſelf the Author of the <hi>Pentarchy,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 400 years before the Birth of Chriſt.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102628:144"/> ſpeaking his Raptures to <hi>Connor,</hi> and among other things, delivering much of the Son of God that was to come down from Heaven to ſave mankind, and was nevertheleſs to ſuffer the moſt cruel death of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> from his own beloved Countrymen the <hi>Jews</hi> whom he came to ſave before any others: <hi>Connor</hi> (ſays <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>) on the hearing of all became ſo affected firſt with the ſtupendious mercy of God to Sinners: and then preſently ſo tranſported againſt the ungrateful <hi>Jews,</hi> that, being in a great Wood at the time of this Diſcourſe, he drew his Sword, fell a ſlaſhing and cutting the Trees about him on every ſide with the greateſt fury could be: imagining he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him ſtill thoſe cruel men that put our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to death: and continued ſo long in this paſſionate action of tranſport, till by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heating himſelf and the opening thereby of ſome old wounds he had in his shull, he died.</p>
               <p>What the Reader may anſwer to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Quere in relation to either of theſe two Kings, I know not. But think nevertheleſs what St. <hi>John Chryſoſtom</hi> would have anſwer'd it very conſequently, at leaſt in reference to the former, had the caſe been debated by him, when he wrote his Three Books <hi>de Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntia Dei,</hi> to <hi>Stargirius,</hi> a holy Monk, that notwithſtanding his holineſs, was through the

               <p>34. But after Chriſtianity had been among the people of <hi>Ireland</hi> univerſally preach'd and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd, yea and all along from time to time in the ſucceeding Ages, not even thoſe very Ages following the horrible deſolations by the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Wars excepted, they had queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs (notwithſtanding all their inteſtin Feuds) many more both Monarchs, Provincial Kings, and other leſſer Kings too, famous in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration as well for other great Vertues, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe peculiar to Religion, as for thoſe of Martial fortitude and Valour. Yet becauſe I perceive this little Book to ſwell inſenſibly beyond my deſign: I paſs over much of that which otherwiſe I would have willingly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in this place. And therefore what I can briefly on the preſent Subject obſerve, is,</p>
               <p>Firſt in general, the wonderful Devotion, Zeal, Religious Liberality of the firſt Chriſtian Monarchs, Provincial Kings, and other great
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102628:145"/> Lords of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who upon their firſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion not only parted ſo readily with the whole Tenths of their Eſtates real and perſonal, nay and of their Subjects alſo, both men and women, by the dedication of all, in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar way to God, as hath been ſaid before, but were ſo fervently Zealous, even to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of exceſs, in this kind, that (as both <hi>Keting</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> relate it) if St. <hi>Patrick</hi> would have receiv'd what they offer'd more, their Succeſſors ſhould have ſcarce been left the grazing of four Beaſts to beſtow on the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly in particular, the great number of thoſe Princes, one after another in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſo many Ages, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the bloody Feuds and warlike humor of their Nation, withdrew themſelves in time from ſin, yea from all the pleaſures, vanity, pomp, earthly glory of their condition, and by contemning the world for the ſake of God, made themſelves greater than the World. A large liſt of them you may find partly in <hi>Keting,</hi> but more amply and exactly in <hi>Lucius.</hi> And they were thoſe that ſtripping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves naked to follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſhutting themſelves up in Cloyſters made choice of the better part with <hi>Mary</hi> at the feet of out Lord.</p>
               <p>Such were the Monarchs, 1. <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

But whether he took upon him the outward profeſſion of a Monk in thoſe exerciſes there, or did not, I can ſay nothing on either ſide. Nor is it very material to know: ſeeing the inward habit of his Soul yielded fruits worthy of true repentance and the ſevereſt outward profeſſion of it. 6. <hi>Rua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruidh O Conchabhair,</hi> the very laſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, we have ſhewn likewiſe before, to have made a religious life, under the Habit and in a Cloiſter of <hi>Auguſtinian</hi> Chanon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, his laſt refuge in this World from ſo many viciſſitudes of Fortune. There it was he became ſo truly wiſe indeed as to prepare only for that other World; which, being planted far above all the glory of the Sun, and all the Circles of time, expects only Souls ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never tainted with ſin at any time, or
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102628:147"/> by perfect repentance, at leaſt before death throughly purified from its deadly ſting. And ſuch indeed, for making choice either ſooner or later of the better part with <hi>Mary,</hi> were thoſe now enumerated Monarchs of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And yet I know not why I might not add to their number <hi>Maolſeachluinn</hi> I. and <hi>Brian Boraimh.</hi> For albeit they never had been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profeſs'd Monks, Anchorites, or Clerks, nor diveſted of their Authority Royal, nor at all outwardly retired from the cares of the Publick, or management of their own dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick affairs, or comfort of their Wives and Children: yet their piety of life was ſuch as purchas'd for them after death the reputation of holy men. Yea S. <hi>Cairbre</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cluan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mhac-Noiſe,</hi> when the former died <hi>Anno</hi> 860. being in extaſy, beheld his Soul aſcending to glory, ſays <hi>Lucius.</hi> And the later has been inſerted not only by <hi>John Wilſon</hi> in his <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologe,</hi> but by <hi>Henry Fitz, Simons</hi> in his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Saints of Ireland:</hi> both theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors having in this particular followed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus Scotus.</hi>

               <p>And after them <hi>Donochadh</hi> (the ſon of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allach,</hi> and Son-in-law to <hi>Donochadh mhac Floinn</hi> the Monarch) King of <hi>Oſſory</hi> is next recorded as a man of exceeding piety and godlineſs, though never ſo profeſs'd Monk, nor at all retir'd in outward appearance from the duties of his ſecular Employment. His care of the poor was ſuch that in his time every houſe in <hi>Oſſory</hi> had three ſeveral Bags for daily Collections of Victuals to feed them. One that receiv'd the tenth part of every perſons meal: none at all of the Family, no not even of the ſervants, excepted. Another deſign'd for the portion of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangel,</hi> as they call'd it. And a third was under the peculiar charge of the good Wife, to ſee all the ſcraps gathered into it. Beſides he was himſelf exceeding bountiful to them. And then his devotion at Church, frequenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, watch over his own ſenſes, delight in all divine things, continual
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:102628:151"/> exerciſe in all good works, made his memory pleaſant and fragrant, and ſweet and precious after his death. The debt of Nature, that open'd for him the paſſage into a bleſſed immortality, he paid in his Father-in-law's Reign over <hi>Ireland,</hi> that is, between the Years 918. when this Monarch <hi>Donochadh mhac Floinn</hi> be gun his reign, and the year 942. when he ended it.</p>
               <p>I might on this occaſion peradventure call to mind what <hi>Keting</hi> has of <hi>Scanlan mor mhic Cinfoala,</hi> a former King of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> his grateful devout liberality in applotting and enjoyning three pence a ſmoak throughout his Countrey, to be paid yearly for ever to <hi>Columb-Cille</hi>'s Abbey there at a place call'd <hi>Durramh.</hi> And I might withal remember how great, how beneficial, yea how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful even to this very <hi>Scanlan</hi> himſelf the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement he had to this Devotion was. For it was no leſs than his miraculous delivery from the very extreameſt rigours of a moſt cruel impriſonment, and twelve chains of Iron loading him, and no drink at all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him to quench his thirſt, when at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum-Cille</hi>'s inſtance for him in prayer to God, he was on a ſudden by an Angel of glory from Heaven reſcued, the Priſon at midnight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, his chains unlooſed, his Keepers thrown down, the Gates open'd, he led forth, and then preſently as it were in another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102628:151"/> of time, both conducted and preſented to his Wonder-working Patron <hi>Columb-Cille</hi> that expected him at that very hour. But as I have partly before touch'd upon the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Obligation laid by this miraculous favour on <hi>Scanlan:</hi> ſo let it ſuffice here to have only mention'd ſo much of his grateful acknowledgment thereof.</p>
               <p>And yet perhaps it may not be amiſs to let the Reader know, what <hi>Lucius</hi> on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid occaſion hath obſerv'd of the Kings of <hi>Oſſory</hi> in general, or indeed rather of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Hiſtorians in relation to them, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe Writers do ſeem all of them to have ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar eſteem for the Kings of <hi>Oſſory</hi> above any other of the Leſſer Kings of <hi>Ireland.</hi> For when they give a Catalogue of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Kings of the <hi>Pentarchy,</hi> that is of thoſe of <hi>South-Mounſter, North-Mounſter, Connaght, Leinſter,</hi> and <hi>

               <p>I return back to the Subject I was on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I now give the only two remaining of thoſe Leſſer Kings, that are celebrated for their prudent piety in their abandoning all they had on earth, taking up their <hi>Croſs</hi> and following <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the poverty, habit and mortifications of a religious Life. Theſe were <hi>Maolmordha Huadomhnail</hi> King of <hi>Cionſallach,</hi> who paid his tribute to Nature <hi>Anno</hi> 1022. and <hi>Vadah O Conchanain</hi> King of <hi>Huadiarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> above a hundred years after; for he ended his days <hi>Anno</hi> 1167.</p>
               <p>Nor have I any other to add to them, but only <hi>Conchabhar O Cealla,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>of the Battles,</hi> King of <hi>Mannech</hi> in <hi>Connaght:</hi> whoſe Chriſtian vertues are wonderfully admired by all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Hiſtorians. Though he was a man that not only till the laſt continued in his ſtation of a Prince and Governour of his People, but a very notable Warriour too, as you ſee that ſurname of his imports, <hi>cui cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomento

That he tyth'd his whole Eſtate three ſeveral times: beſtowed the Tenth of it on the Churches; the Ninth on the poor, and the Eighth part on the Clerks and others that came for aſſiſtance and relief to his Houſe. 3. That after all being warr'd upon by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabhar Moinmhuigh</hi> (ſon to <hi>Ruaruidgh</hi> the laſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarch) by the <hi>Mac Teigs</hi> alſo, and other great Lords aſſociated againſt him: and an agreement made between both ſides to put the quarrel to the iſſue of a pitch'd Battel, with this caution and mutual promiſe, that neither ſhould come unto it nor fight in it with Armour, <hi>i. e.</hi> with breaſt, or back, or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergion, or any coat of Maile: and he for his part moſt religiouſly out of meer conſcience of his word, keeping to that caution; but they on the other ſide, without any regard of theirs,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102628:153"/> having dealt perfidiouſly by covering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Armour under their Caſſocks: the iſſue was the ſlaughtering of a great number of his Army, the routing of the reſt, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him among others in the Field; which they call the Field or Battel of <hi>Srugheal,</hi> fought in the year of our Saviour Chriſt, 1180. 4. That upon the news, thoſE 360 Penſioners above mention'd of his, though not living together in one place, but far and wide diſtant in their ſeveral Habitations, yet in all the haſt they could, arriving all of them on the third day where his Body was; and there, upon the ſight of it, firſt giving way to Nature by venting their extream grief in abundance of tears, groans, and lamentations for him, but more eſpecially becauſe he that maintain'd ſo many Miniſters for God, had not ſo much as any one of them, or any other ſuch to aſſoil him or comfort him in the laſt hour: then taking his head (for it was cut off) and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to his body: and this done, laying themſelves on their knees, they prai'd, &amp;c. crying to God mightily, and with wonderful Faith beſeech'd him to return back the Soul of their dear Benefactor into his Body, while he prepar'd himſelf by repentance and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and the Sacraments of Chriſt for a more quiet, and hopeful departure. 5. Laſtly, That their prayers were ſo efficacious, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:102628:153"/> the mercy of God ſo extraordinarily propitious to <hi>Conchabhar,</hi> that he revived preſently, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd his ſins, received the holy <hi>Viaticum;</hi> but then, as he told them, choſe rather to die than live any longer. Adding withal, that the true cauſe why God would have him defeated and kill'd in that Battle was, that he had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently puniſh'd ſome wickedneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his Brother. Which yet he had not forgiven, but only delai'd to judg: as having never once heard of it before that very morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he was preparing for Battel, and conſequently his Soul taken up wholly with other cares. Whereby, ſays <hi>Gratianus Lucius,</hi> relating this matter at large, and quoting <hi>O Duvegan</hi> for it, we may gueſs at the condition of thoſe Governors that wilfully and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately not only delay the puniſhment of ſo many horrible crimes they ſee daily commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even againſt all Juſtice and Religion; but reſolve never to puniſh them. <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But if you be of an other judgment, as to this Maxim I mean, <hi>That he is cruel to the good who ſpares the wicked:</hi> or if peradventure you boggle at the miraculous part either of this Relation of <hi>Conchabhar O Cealla's death,</hi> or of the former enumeration of ſuch <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chriſtian Monarchs, Provincial and other Leſſer Kings who have been famous in their time for piety:
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102628:154"/> you may paſs it over, and leave it to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and credulity of other men that have not the ſame apprehenſions, doubts or ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as they have not the ſame ſoul with you. I am ſure that laying all ſuch matters aſide, there is among thoſe great Examples of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, enough ſtill remaining to edifie any good Chriſtian, or any ſober man alive. Though I muſt tell you withal, that as no Writer holds himſelf accountable either for the verity or falſity of any other matters of Fact whatſoever written by him out of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hiſtory: ſo much leſs for thoſe of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. And yet further I muſt acknowledg, that I know not whether any man writing purpoſely of a Nation or People that both firmly do believe ſuch miraculous works to have been wrought by God among their Predeceſſors, and would perhaps hold it a very invidious malevolent diminution of their glory for ſuch a man to paſs them over wholly in ſilence, it were juſt or prudential in him to do ſo. However I have avoided the two extreams. I have not been wholly ſilent as to ſuch matters: nor have I given but a very few of them. Beſides, I do not interpoſe a ſyllable of my own judgment. Though I would nevertheleſs be as free either to aſſent or diſſent, or even to ſuſpend as any other upon ſufficient ground. But enough of this:

               <p>35. The third is an Appendix to what has been hitherto ſaid of the perſonal piety of thoſe Princes. For I am now to give in order what was done partly by ſome of the very ſame partly by other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Kings, Princes, Lords, as well to reform the Commonwealth, regulate the Church, reſtore Learning to the Nation, as to promote Chriſtian religious piety among all their Subjects no leſs than in themſelves. And all this, I mean acted by them after the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral calamity of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Wars: yea and acted by them notwithſtanding their own ſo frequent relapſes at this very time into their old Feuds again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brian Boraimh,</hi> ſo often mention'd, but never enough praiſed, muſt be the firſt Inſtance in this place. He ſet all men free from the exactions of the <hi>Danes.</hi> All the ſpoils gained by him from the <hi>Danes,</hi> he beſtow'd on others. All the Lands and Territories of the Kingdom he reſtor'd to the ancient Proprietors and lawful Heirs; not retaining to himſelf or any Relations one foot of Land belonging to others. He conferr'd on each Temporal Lord great Priviledges and Immunities, according to his degree. He reſtored to each Biſhop his own Dioceſs, to each Prieſt his Church throughout <hi>Ireland.</hi> He founded, built, endow'd many Churches,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:102628:155"/> Schools, Colledges: and with Royal munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, care, ſolicitude gave a new beginning again to the deſtroy'd Univerſities. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on every perſon that would learn, money to bear his charges competently. He built at his own proper coſt the Cathedral of <hi>Cill-da-Luagh,</hi> the Church of <hi>Inis Cealtrach,</hi> and re-edified the Steeple of <hi>Tuaim-Ghreine.</hi> He built many Bridges, made many Cauſeys, mended many High ways before not paſſable. He erected many new Forts, ſtrengthened the old ones with new Bulwarks, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fortified <hi>Caſhel</hi> the uſual manſion of the <hi>Mounſter</hi> Kings. He re-edified all the Royal Houſes or Palaces in <hi>Mounſter,</hi> that before his time had been either utterly ruin'd or wholly neglected, in particular thirteen of them. His Government was ſo rigid that under it a young Woman travail'd all alone from <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruidh</hi> to <hi>Cliodhna,</hi> the length of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with a gold Ring hanging on the top of a Wand in her hand, without meeting any that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to rob or raviſh her. Beſides he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd not on the Sovereignty by murdering or killing his Predeceſſor, as ſo many others did, who nevertheleſs were not tax'd with Uſurpation, becauſe of their deſcent from the Royal Line: and yet <hi>Brian</hi> was undoubtedly of the Line from <hi>Heber.</hi> Moreover, he was gloriouſly magnificent in his Port. No man
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102628:155"/> could carry Arms in his Court, where ever it chanc'd to be, except only <hi>Dal-Gheaſs</hi> that were his own peculiar Guards. All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Ireland</hi> every one, and ſome leſſer Countreys too, beſides the <hi>Danes</hi> inhabiting <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Limmeric,</hi> lay under a conſiderable <hi>Boraimh,</hi> or Tax which they paid yearly for the maintenance of his Houſe at <hi>Ceann-Chora, viz.

That he never enacted one farthing, never any kind of <hi>Boraimh</hi> or Tax of the Provinces, yet was abundantly furniſh'd by them all along with all kind of neceſſaries to ſupport his Regal dignity. 3. That he made very good, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome convenieent Laws for his People. 4. That <hi>Lanfrancus,</hi> then Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> loved him entirely; remembred him ſtill in his Prayers: did all the good Offices he could to his Friends: calls him tacitly a lover of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:102628:156"/> Juſtice: and then expreſly adds, <hi>Magnam mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordiam populis Hiberniae tunc divinitus col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latam, quando omnipotens Deus Terdelacho mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifico Hiberniae Regi jus Regiae poteſtatis ſuper illam terram conceſſit,</hi> That Almighty God had then ſhewed great mercy to the people of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> when he gave the Royal power of that Land to the magnificent King <hi>Toirrghiallach.</hi> The Letters of <hi>Lanfrancus,</hi> containing theſe Elogies of him are quoted by <hi>Lucius,</hi> page 83.</p>

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102628:157"/> us withal, that in this Council <hi>Gillaſpuic</hi> (whom he calls in Latin <hi>Gilbertus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>) Abbot of <hi>Beannchuir,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Limmeric,</hi> and Legat for the Pope was Preſident: and that in all, it conſiſted of fifty Biſhops; whereof the ſaid Preſident was the firſt, <hi>Celſus</hi> (in Iriſh <hi>Ceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach</hi>) ſucceſſor to St. <hi>Patrick</hi> at <hi>Ardmagh</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Maolmuire Huadanain</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Mounſter</hi> the third: beſides three hundred Prieſts and three thouſand other Eccleſiaſticks preſent. Another of them was held at the foreſaid <hi>Fiadh-mhac Naonghuſſa,</hi> then (if I underſtand <hi>Keting</hi> aright) when all the Eſtates were aſſembled there.

But for the Acts of this Council we need not be inquiſitive, ſince the ſame <hi>Keting</hi> has plainly told us they are loſt.

The number of Biſhops conven'd, I do not find. But I ſee clearly enough, their main buſineſs was to reduce the number of Biſhops in the whole Iſland: and to aſſign to each Biſhop his own peculiar Dioceſs, with the meers and bounds thereof, partly (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to prevent diſputes about Juriſdiction, and partly that the Flock might be the more carefully obſerv'd. They did both ſucceſsfully. And for the number they ordered it ſhould be ſix and twenty in all: twelve of them in <hi>Leath Cuinn,</hi> and twelve in <hi>Leath Mogh,</hi> and two in <hi>Meath.</hi> Of the twelve in <hi>Leath-Cuinn,</hi> ſix, were in the Province of <hi>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102628:158"/> are different from thoſe we know at preſent. And ſo did they name, in the very Acts of the ſame Council, the peculiar Meers of each Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, all round about every where through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Kingdom. The Annals of <hi>Inis Fail,</hi> as <hi>Lucius</hi> quotes 'em ſay this Synod (or rather perhaps the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly conſiſting as well of the Lay Eſtates, as of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> ſitting in the ſame Place) made better Laws than <hi>Ireland</hi> ever had before at any time.

The Novelty, or at leaſt Rarity of a National Synod in that Kingdom.

The Fame of ſo great a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacerdotal Order and ſtate Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, intended by the reducing the number of Biſhops, and bounding their Dioceſſes, might have drawn many to come thither. 3.

               <p>What I would principally obſerve by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that Synod at <hi>Rath-Breſſail</hi> is, firſt, how ſhort this number of 26 Biſhops in all <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> comes of that other of 350 Biſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated before <hi>page</hi> 56. out of <hi>Nennius</hi> and <hi>Jocelin</hi> to have been conſecrated by St. <hi>Patrick</hi> in his time for that Countrey. But it may be ſaid, that was a time of labouring in the converſion of every part of that Kingdom, and its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions abroad in <hi>Scotland</hi> and other adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Iſlands. To which purpoſe it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient there ſhould be a very great number of Biſhops, according to the greatneſs of the Harveſt, which was all (at leaſt as to <hi>Ireland</hi> at home) made up in 35 years. Beſides, that in 61 or 62 years, the long term of Saint <hi>Patrick</hi>'s life after he had enter'd on that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, e'en ſo many hundred Biſhops as are mention'd by the ſaid Authors, might have died in <hi>Ireland</hi> and the adjacent Iſlands, tho never the fifth or ſixth part of them had lived together in any one time. And yet I muſt confeſs, there was in later times, and even but a little before this Council, a moſt corrupt cuſtom in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that multiplyed Biſhops <hi>pro libitu Metropolitani,</hi> at the ſole Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans pleaſure, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, and whence that corruption, with many other, proceeded. However, to return to my main purpoſe. <hi>Muirchiortach O Brien</hi> King of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:102628:159"/> (whether alone, or in aſſociation with <hi>Domhnal</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ardghal,</hi> enjoying that Title) was ſo happy as to have by his Royal Authority concurr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d unto, compaſs'd, and confirm'd this material point of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſtabliſhment of the State Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical.</p>

He built the three chief Bridges of <hi>Connaght;</hi> among which that of <hi>Athlone</hi> was. He had the Cathedral of <hi>Tuam</hi> ſolemnly conſecrated by a number of Biſhops call'd thither of purpoſe. He built a Hoſpital in the ſame Town, and endow'd it with Lands. He ſetled a yearly Penſion for a Divinity Profeſſor at <hi>Ardmagh.</hi> He was ſo juſtly ſevere in puniſhing Criminals, that having impriſon'd his own ſon for ſome great Offence, and rejected for a long time the interceſſion of ſeveral both Princes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, he could hardly at laſt be induced even by five hundred Prieſts and eleven Biſhops together with the Archbiſhops of <hi>Ardmagh</hi> and <hi>Caſhel</hi> appearing before him and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding for the Priſoner, to ſet him at liberty after a twelve months impriſonment. Of his piety, beſides what I have ſaid already, theſe are further proofs given by <hi>Lucius</hi> I.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102628:160"/> That he caus'd the <hi>Holy Croſs</hi> to be carried about <hi>Ireland</hi> in great veneration. 2. That he beſtowed great ſcopes of Land on the Clergy of <hi>Tuam:</hi> on the Succeſſor of Saint <hi>Coman</hi> a Town: and on the Biſhop of <hi>Cluain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mhac-Noiſe</hi> a number of Silver Croſſes, Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and Chalices. And 3. That by his laſt Will he bequeath'd to ſeveral Churches all the coſtly furniture of his Houſes; all his Gold and ſilver Plate; all his Jewels; all his Horſes and Arms, even his very Bow and Quiver; beſides 540 ounces of Gold, and 40 marks of Silver.</p>
               <p>His immediate Follower in the Sovereignty <hi>Muirchiortach mhac Neill</hi> was pleas'd himſelf in perſon, together with all the Kings and Nobles of the whole Kingdom to be preſent in the National Synod of that Church held at <hi>Ceannannais</hi> (we call it now <hi>Kells</hi>) in <hi>Meath,</hi> in the firſt year of his Reign, which was of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 1152. This Council begun the 7th of <hi>March,</hi> being <hi>Dominica Laetare Hieruſalem,</hi> had members of it preſent ſeven and twenty Biſhops, and as many more Abbots and Priors; the Archbiſhops of <hi>Ardmagh</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> beſides ſive elect, being of the number of thoſe 27 Biſhops. It was in this Council that <hi>John Papiron,</hi> Cardinal of St. <hi>Laurence in Damaſco,</hi> ſent by Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> III. preſided. In this
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102628:160"/> Council that he by the Authority of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Apoſtolical Lord <hi>Eugenius</hi> condemned Simony, execrated Uſury, enjoyn'd the payment of Tithes. In this Council, beſides that he deliver'd the 4 Palls to the 4 Archbiſhops, <hi>Ardmagh, Caſhel, Tuam, Dublin.</hi> Moreover it was in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil that he ordain'd, as it was fit, that <hi>Ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh</hi> ſhould be Primat over all. And theſe things being done by him, without further delay he departed, and on the Ninth of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of <hi>May</hi> the ſame Year ſhip'd for beyond Seas. So <hi>Keting</hi> writes of him and this Council, out of the Annals of <hi>Cluain Eidh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioch Fiontain</hi> in <hi>Leaſe:</hi> where he tranſcribes the very <hi>Latin</hi> words of thoſe Annals. Tho according to an other account of his own, <hi>Giolla Crioſt</hi> (or <hi>Chriſtianus) O Conneric</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Liſmore</hi> Provincial of all the Monks in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Legat in ordinary from the Pope in that Kingdom preſided in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil jointly with the ſaid Cardinal. But what is more obſervable in thoſe Annals is, That as to the 4 Palls moſt of the Clergy in this Council, and eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Dun-da-Leath-Ghlaſs</hi> and <hi>Ardmach</hi> were diſſenting: becauſe they held it enough for <hi>Ireland</hi> to have two Archbiſhops, the one at <hi>Ardmach,</hi> the other in <hi>Mounſter,</hi> as formerly. The reſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Council, and particular names and

               <p>And yet I judg it not impertinent on this occaſion to mind the Reader of <hi>Meredith Hanmer</hi>'s groſs miſtake; where, in his Hiſtory of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he ſays 1. That before this time or Council of <hi>Ceannannais,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any Archbiſhops. 2. That ever ſince <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monks time (or his miſſion to <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi>) the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergy till this time had been ſubject to the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Whereas in truth they had all along from St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s time, and by his own ſpecial appointment too, even two Archbiſhops: the one ſtiled of <hi>Ardmach;</hi> the other of <hi>Mounſter</hi> firſt, then of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> after he came to have his fixed See there: the one for <hi>Leath-Cuinn,</hi> and the other of <hi>Leath-Mogha.</hi> Whereof you may ſee more at large in <hi>Keting;</hi> who in his Reign of <hi>Laogirius</hi> tells the very motive and chief inducement St. <hi>Patrick</hi> had for making the ſecond chief Archiepiſcopal See, and conſtituting it in <hi>Mounſter.</hi> Nay I have my ſelf read in ſome of the Saints of <hi>Irelands</hi> Lives (though I have not them by me now to quote them) mention made of the Archbiſhop of the <hi>Lagenians,</hi> and his See
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102628:161"/> being ſometimes <hi>Kildare,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Ferns:</hi> and ſo I have of the Archbiſhop of the <hi>Cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> too, if my memory fail me not. But if it do, Sir <hi>James Ware</hi> in his Commentary <hi>de Praeſulibus Hiberniae</hi> ſupplies it abundantly, <hi>page</hi> 174. concerning <hi>Mounſter:</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 243. and 244. concerning <hi>Connaght.</hi> What Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Juriſdiction theſe Archbiſhops had in thoſe days of old, is an other queſtion: or whether they had any more than only to be <hi>Epiſcopi primae ſedis</hi> in their Province? or prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of place? I can ſay nothing to it. But in this I can be on rational grounds poſitive, That none of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergy depended on the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> none of their Biſhops received conſecration from any of them, until <hi>Lanfraneus</hi> in <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> time, was the Archbiſhop of that See. Nor then, nor after neither, but for ſome little time thoſe only of <hi>Dublin, Wexford, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Limmeric.</hi> And the reaſon why theſe in particular would or did ſo depend was, That their Townſmen and ſubordinate pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Governors were <hi>Danes</hi> or <hi>Eaſterlings,</hi> now turn'd Chriſtians. And that they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prelats would not favourably judg or determine of their Elections in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of their own Citizens, blood, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen to Eccleſiaſtical Offices; but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at leaſt of the former Feuds, if not thoſe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102628:162"/> preſent and remaining ſtill would prefer <hi>Iriſh</hi> to them. And therefore, and further yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they expected in that behalf impartial dealing and juſtice, if not favour too, from the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as being of late brought under the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerors, originally their own Countreymen, they procured Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Kings to have their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops conſecrated by the Archbiſhops of that See. whereby it happened, that ſo lately as the Reign of the Monarch <hi>Toirrghiallach,</hi> Grandchild to <hi>Brien Boraimh,</hi> in the Year of Chriſt 1098. the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Waterford</hi> was conſecrated by <hi>Anſelmus</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> So ſays <hi>Keting;</hi> and much more <hi>Lucius;</hi> and moſt of all on this Subject the moſt eminently famous Primat <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> who was both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for his own See of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion able enough to ſearch into theſe matters. To him may be added Sir <hi>James Ware,</hi> pag. 102. 103, and 104. where he tells us of <hi>Patric, Donatus O Haingly, Samuel O Haingly</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> four Biſhops elected ſucceſſively by the <hi>Ooſtmans</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and and conſecrated for that See by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops of <hi>Canterbury, Lanfrancus, Anſelmus,</hi> and <hi>Rudolphus;</hi> but no more: for the next Biſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> was conſecrated by <hi>Ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh.</hi>

               <p>Having thus reflected on thoſe Errors of <hi>Hanmer,</hi> I have no more to ſay in relation to the Council of <hi>Ceannannais,</hi> but that all the advantage, benefit, glory redounding from it to the <hi>Iriſh Church,</hi> ought queſtionleſs to be attributed chiefly to the foreſaid King and Monarch of Ireland <hi>Muirchiortach mhac Neill,</hi> that rendred it both much more auguſt by his own Royal preſence, and much more effectual by his perfect ſubmiſſion to all its Decrees.</p>
               <p>A further ſtrong argument of great reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taken by many of the Kings, Princes, Nobles, Eccleſiaſticks of <hi>Ireland</hi> to reſtore ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, juſtice, learning; and, above all, Piety and holineſs of Life, once more among their Countreymen, was the great number of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries built and endow'd by them within the very laſt eighty years of their <hi>Mileſian</hi> Government before the final period of it.

For though the King, before his departure, had made this very man not only to give Hoſtages, but take his corporal Oath, that he would invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably be and keep at peace with <hi>Malachias;</hi> yet, without regard of either, he ſoon after in a conſult of his own People determines the place, and time and manner to diſpatch him: comes thereupon with his <hi>Aſſaſſines</hi> to <hi>Ardmagh:</hi> and after Evenſong had been end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

And yet <hi>Malachias,</hi> after ſome other words of comfort and edification, telling them it became not the Diſciple of Chriſt to fear death, immediately departs, accompanied only with three reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men reſolv'd to die with him: enters the Houſe: ſees the <hi>Aſſaſſins</hi> all together in the ſame Room with that great man their Leader; as they were prepared to aſſaſſinate him: and yet coming up a little nearer finds them all every one ſtrangely ſeized as with ſome panick fear appalled, aſtoniſh'd, mute, as if they had been Planet-ſtruck, as if they were unable to lift up an armed hand againſt him or any other.

Then by the dreadful Judgments fallen upon the two remaining chiefeſt, boldeſt and moſt blaſphemouſly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent detractors of his Name, a Man and Woman of the accurſed Race: the man's tongue rotting in his mouth, ſpitting out Worms almoſt continually for ſeven days, and together with them at laſt his miſerable Soul: the Woman turned frantick, crying out fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that ſhe was a ſtrangling by <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi> and in that wretched condition yielding up her ghoſt. Finally, by the univerſal ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror fallen upon all his Enemies, conſidering now at laſt ſo many Wonders wrought in his behalf; and therefore crying one to an other now, as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> did of old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Let us fly from the Face of <hi>Malachias,</hi> for God fighteth for him. Tho too late indeed for that adulterous generation of Vipers, who by this time were all of them every one periſh'd: without leaving either Heir or other memory behind them, ſave only that of their having continued the ſacrilegious poſſeſſion, violation, pollution, deſtruction of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:102628:172"/> the Sanctuary of God well nigh 200 years.</p>
               <p>And ſuch indeed were the means, and ſuch the degrees and order of them, by which the Almighty himſelf fitted, prepared, carried on, placed at laſt his beloved <hi>Malachias</hi> in that full power, which he had from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning deſign'd for him; undoubtedly of purpoſe to repair thoſe lamentable ruins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe horible corruptions, enlighten that univerſal darkneſs, and breath new life again into the whole Body of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Church, that really for ſo many Ages before did ſeem, at leaſt for the greater part of it, utterly dead.</p>
               <p>But that which appears to me moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this holy man is, that having within three years of his acceptation of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>political charge of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> and but a twelve month after his inſtalment in the See or the Cathedral it ſelf, humbled, nay brought to nothing all the proud Uſurpers, reſtored the Church, extinguiſh'd Barbariſm, reform d every where throughout the Dioceſs all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of People by Chriſtian Diſciplin: ſeeing now all in peace, and remembring his own former purpoſe, he ordain'd another, by name <hi>Gilla-Joſa,</hi> alias <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> in his own ſtead Biſhop of <hi>Ardmagh;</hi> gave him poſſeſſion, and notwithſtanding the reluctance of others, without further delay retired to his former Spouſe the poor ſubordinat Church of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:102628:172"/> That becauſe he now underſtood this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Conner</hi> had, but in later times, an other Biſhoprick, I mean that of <hi>Down,</hi> united to it; and becauſe himſelf upon his tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Ardmagh</hi> had ordained a Biſhop in <hi>Conner:</hi> he would neither intrude upon him, nor yet ſuffer any longer that Union made by covetouſneſs to continue; but reſtoring the ancient diviſion, aſſum'd to himſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> to his own peculiar charge, the poorer and leaſt reform'd of the two the Biſhoprick of <hi>Down.</hi> That here again calling to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and erecting a new Convent of <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> he devoted himſelf among them to his former courſe of Life, in all poverty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and rigours of cenobial Diſcipline, aſſiduity of Prayer and raptures of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, ſpending all the time he could ſpare from his Paſtoral charge.</p>
               <p>What follows next is to let you know, that he was not ſuffered long the enjoyment of himſelf in thoſe <hi>aſcetick</hi> exerciſes. That ere long there was an univerſal conflux of all ſorts of people to him, even from the higheſt to the very loweſt of the Land. That therefore now he finds it neceſſary, like the Husbandmen in the Goſpel, to go forth and ſow his ſeed: and now he diſpoſes with all Authority of all kind of Church affairs: and no man queſtions him, by what power he did

                  </gap>itting to take a journey to <hi>Rome</hi> and conſult the See Apoſtolick, as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Apoſtles at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> after his three years preaching of Chriſt in <hi>Arabia.</hi> Beſides he conſidered that the See of <hi>Ardmagh</hi> had never at any time had the Metropolitical Ornament, which they call <hi>Pallium;</hi> a word that in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical uſe of it imports the <hi>plenitude of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> ſays <hi>Bernard;</hi> but not the <hi>plenitude of power,</hi> as they ſpeak at <hi>Rome</hi> in this Age. Moreover, that his late Predeceſſor in the Metropolitan Church, I mean <hi>Celſus,</hi> had by his own authority erected another Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical See elſe where in <hi>Ireland,</hi> though with dependence and ſubjection ſtill to the See of <hi>Ardmagh</hi> as the only <hi>Primatial</hi> or <hi>Patriarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> See of the Kingdom. That to obtain from the See Apoſtolick of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well the honour of the <hi>Pall</hi> for each of thoſe two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Metropolitan Sees, as the confirmation of what <hi>Celſus</hi> had done in erecting the later of them, was another chief motive of his undertaking ſuch a Journey. That having paſs'd through <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> reſted a few days with St. <hi>Bernard</hi> at <hi>Claravallis</hi> in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102628:173"/> 
                  <hi>France,</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> continued there for a month viſiting the holy places, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring much from time to time with his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who was very inquiſitive of all the concerns of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the nature of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and eſpecially what Wonders God had lately done by his Miniſtery there: he obtain'd indeed the confirmation of that new Metropolitical See erected by <hi>Celſus;</hi> but was put off the preſent grant of thoſe <hi>Palls</hi> deſired by him. That the Pope told him, that by reaſon <hi>Gillaſpuic</hi> (or <hi>Gilbertus)</hi> being now grown old and infirm, had ſignified ſo much, and his deſire to he caſed of the <hi>Legatin</hi> care, it was neceſſary he ſhould undertake it, and in that quality return back and hold a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Synod of the whole Nation. Which when he had done, and by general conſent and fitting meſſengers deſired the <hi>Pallia,</hi> they ſhould be granted. And therefore told him alſo in plain terms, he could by no means yield to his firſt and moſt earneſt petition of all, though by ſo many tears ſolicited by him, <hi>viz.</hi> that it might be lawful for him to retire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to <hi>Claravallis,</hi> and live and die there with <hi>Bernard.</hi> That with this anſwer he is now diſmiſs'd by the Pope, but as with all delegable power, ſo with all imaginable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reſpect, kiſſing him and putting his own Mitre on his head, his own ſtole about
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:102628:174"/> his neck, and his own maniple on his arm: which <hi>Malachias</hi> ever after uſed in officiating at the Altar. That having return'd by <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravallis,</hi> left there four of his own diſciples to be educated in the Monaſtic Life by Saint <hi>Bernard:</hi> from thence proceeded on in his Journey, and in his way through <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the inſtance of the good King <hi>David,</hi> by praying over the young Prince <hi>Robert</hi> his Son and Heir, recovered him inſtantly from the jaws of death; for he was quite given over by the Phyſitians: landed ſoon after at his beloved <hi>Beannchuir</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland:</hi> he put himſelf immediately on the work of a true Legat indeed. And this for many years, without any intermiſſion, going about all the Provinces, holding frequent Synods, in all the quarters of the Land; reſtoring vigour to the old <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church: adding new ones that were of uſe: reforming all the corruptions, both new and old: preaching e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where like an other <hi>Helias,</hi> or ſome Angel of Heaven come down on Earth. No Age, no Sex, no condition, no profeſſion could abſcond from his Beams, or hinder the operation of them. Whatever Decrees he made, whatever <hi>Canons</hi> he publiſh'd were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently accepted, ſubmitted unto, obey'd, as Oracles without any contradiction at all. Nor had any perſon, Man or Woman, Prince or
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:102628:174"/> Prelat, or Peaſant, or Monarch, the daring heart to reſiſt him in any thing: becauſe they daily ſaw before their eyes the ſigns wrought by him. You may read <hi>cap.</hi> 5. 8. 9. of his Life, written by St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> a good many of them; though few in reſpect of thoſe he paſſes over, as the ſame holy Author St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſays. And among them you may find the expulſion of Devils, and healing all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and reviving the Dead to Life, and the ſtriking alſo of ſome impious wicked Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers with an exemplary death to terrifie others. And all theſe miraculous works above Nature, done by the God of Nature, at the ſole invocation of his Name by <hi>Malachias,</hi> without any other application, without any charm uſed by him, than that ſometimes of lifting up his eyes to Heaven or a ſhort Prayer, ſometimes of a longer continued with faſting and weeping on God twenty four hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Unleſs peradventure his laying his hand on a deſperate man, brought to him bound in cords, by reaſon of a furious frenzy that poſſeſs'd him: or his touching with his finger the tongue of a Young Girl that was mute: or his bleſſing a Cup of Drink, and ſending it to a Woman ſo long paſt her Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, that all her Neighbours wondred ſhe was not dead: or his ſprinkling of water, hallowed by himſelf, upon a wicked Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:102628:175"/> that lay long Bedrid: or his invoking the name of God on three Apples, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to a Lady in the laſt agonies of death: be reputed a Diabolical Charm.</p>
               <p>And yet after all I am of <hi>Bernard</hi>'s opinion, that the firſt and greateſt Miracle wrought by <hi>Malachias</hi> was himſelf. From the firſt day of his converſion to the laſt of his Life, <hi>ſine proprio vixit,</hi> he lived without property in any kind of thing. Even when he was Biſhop he had neither man-ſervant nor maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, nor Town, nor Village, nor Land nor one farthing either of Eccleſiaſtical or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Revenue, no not for allowance to his Epiſcopal Table. He had not ſo much as a Houſe of his own. He almoſt inceſſantly went about the Pariſhes preaching the Goſpel, and living on the Goſpel as our Lord had ſhew'd him the Example: ſave only that for moſt part he preach'd it without putting his Auditory to the charge of entertaining him; but maintain'd himſelf, and his Religious Train, by the labour of his own hands and theirs. When he found it neceſſary to take a little reſt, he took it in ſome of the holy places founded by himſelf in all Countreys of the Kingdom. (For it was he that was the great Reſtorer of the Monaſtick Life and Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in <hi>Ireland:</hi> where, for ſo many Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>i. e.</hi> ever ſince the Univerſal deſolation
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:102628:175"/> by the <hi>Danes,</hi> the people generally, though they had heard of the name, yet they never ſaw any ſuch thing as a Monk, till he begun. <hi>A diebus antiquis Monachi quidem nomen audierunt, mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum non viderunt:</hi> ſays <hi>Malachias</hi> himſelf. <hi>Vit. cap.</hi> xi. And whereſoever he reſted, how ſhor tor how long ſoever his abode was, he conform'd to all their obſervances, their Habit, their Table, their Diet. Inſomuch, that as to the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour man, he could not be diſcovered from the meaneſt Brother of the Houſe. Laſtly, in his going about the Pariſhes or Countreys either to preach or to viſit, he never made uſe of Horſe, or Coach or Waggon, he went a foot conſtantly, as likewiſe did all his Train, though now both Biſhop and Legat. And was not all this, trow you, to be a true Heir indeed, a true Succeſſor to the Apoſtles? or was it not in <hi>Malachias,</hi> to be himſelf the firſt and laſt and greateſt of his Miracles? <hi>O virum Apoſtolicum, quem tot &amp; talia nobilitant ſigna Apoſtolatus ſui! Quid ergo mirum, ſi mira operatus eſt ſic mirabilis ipſo! Imo verò non ipſe, ſed Deus in ipſo. Alioquin tu es Deus (inquit) qui facis mirabilia,</hi> ſays <hi>Bernard,</hi> exclaiming here with admiration of this wonderful man. However, this Life he led for about a dozen years, perpetually going about all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, reforming all the abuſes, doing good to all mortals, and working thoſe other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:102628:176"/> ſigns every where that I have touch'd upon before.</p>
               <p>At laſt underſtanding that <hi>Innocent</hi> II. was dead: and after him within ſixteen months more <hi>Celeſtin</hi> II. and <hi>Luoius</hi> the ſecond too: and that <hi>Eugenius</hi> III. a Diſciple of Saint <hi>Bernards,</hi> being choſen to ſucceed them, was come ſo near as <hi>France:</hi> he calls a <hi>National Synod,</hi> holds it, diſpatches in the three firſt days of it what was thought expedient as to Reformation: on the fourth propoſes that of ſending to the See Apoſtolick for the Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Enſigns called <hi>Pallia:</hi> offers himſelf to be the Solicitor of it in perſon: and tho with great difficulty to part with him at all for any time, yet obtains their conſent, the rather that the Pope was ſo near. And now he takes his Journey again through <hi>Scotland:</hi> where being receiv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d with all veneration by King <hi>David,</hi> he founds the laſt of his Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, at a place call'd (<hi>ſtagnum viride</hi>) the <hi>Green Lake;</hi> haviug to that purpoſe brought with him out of <hi>Ireland</hi> a ſufficient number of <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Monks. And then he goes forward the ſecond time to <hi>Claravallis</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> taking that in his way to <hi>Rome,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope before his arrival on that ſide of the Sea was returned. And finally now, and from hence, <hi>i. e.</hi> from <hi>Claravallis,</hi> but after a few days of ſickneſs, and by a death
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:102628:176"/> anſwerable in all reſpects to his life, he is call'd to glory on that very day which himſelf had both deſired and foretold, the day of the <hi>Commemoration of all faithful ſouls depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> which, as I have noted before, was in the Year of Chriſt 1148.</p>
               <p>More particulars, either of his life, or death, or miracles, whoever deſires may find them at large in the funeral Sermon preach'd, and Life alſo moſt exactly and divinely written of him even by St. <hi>Bernard</hi> himſelf. Who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other Abbots, and the whole <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtercian</hi> Convent of <hi>Claravallis,</hi> was preſent with him at his death; as they all miniſtred to him all along in his ſickneſs. And it is even this very <hi>Bernard,</hi> that with his own Eyes beheld the great Miracle which he tells wrought on a <hi>Paralitick</hi> by touching the hand of <hi>Malachias,</hi> while after his death he was yet expos'd in publick before Burial.</p>
               <p>But it is not for the ſake of this or any other Miracle wrought by him, that I have dilated ſo much upon him; but to ſhew the ſtate of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> in thoſe days out of ſo good an Author as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> is. For in that Life of <hi>Malachias</hi> written by him (beſides many other points relating directly to the moſt healthful uſe of Confeſſion, <hi>ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrimum uſum confeſſionis</hi> are <hi>Bernards</hi> own words, and the Sacrament of extream Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:102628:177"/> and the real preſence of Chriſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Hoſt, and Prayers for the Dead: all which I paſs over as not to the purpoſe of this Hiſtorical Diſcourſe:) it is very obſervable, That ſo bleſſed a Man as <hi>Ceallach</hi> was, even by the character of a Saint (<hi>Sanctus Celſus</hi>) given him by <hi>Colganus,</hi> and ſo learned withal, as Sir <hi>James Ware</hi> repreſents him to have been, did without conſulting the See Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>Rome,</hi> and did I ſay by his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority alone as <hi>Primat</hi> of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> erect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Metropolitical See in <hi>Ireland.</hi> That, not even at any time from the beginning, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Church, or Metropolitans thereof, until this time of <hi>Malachias</hi> either had, or (for ought we know) ever deſired the <hi>Pallium;</hi> but without it exercis'd all plenitude of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiſcopal and Primatial juriſdiction all over <hi>Ireland.</hi> Beſides we may plainly ſee by whoſe ſolicitation at firſt the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was moved in the concern of <hi>Palls</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And that Cardinal <hi>John Papiron</hi>'s bringing them to <hi>Ireland,</hi> about four years after the death of <hi>Malachias,</hi> was undoubtedly an effect of thoſe two Journeys made by him out of <hi>Ireland</hi> to obtain them. Albeit we know not certainly whether it was <hi>Malachias</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſo many as were brought by <hi>Papiron.</hi> Or whether, after his death others did ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt for the reaſonableneſs and expediency
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:102628:177"/> of ſo many, that in <hi>Ireland</hi> were chiefly four Parti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But enough on this Subject relating to <hi>Malachias,</hi> the former of thoſe two extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Saints rais'd by God in the decrepit Age of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchy.</p>
               <p>The later of them was a <hi>Leinſter</hi> man of Noble Deſcent: his <hi>Iriſh</hi> name and ſirname <hi>Laurace O Tuathil</hi> (in Engliſh, <hi>Laurence Tool:</hi>) his Father <hi>Muirchiortach O Tuathil,</hi> Lord of <hi>Imaile</hi> and peradventure ſome other ſmall adjoyning Tracts in the County of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe:</hi> his Mother, <hi>Inghin J. Bhrian,</hi> i. e. one of <hi>O Brian</hi>'s Daughters: and he the youngeſt of all their Children. But for the name of <hi>Laurence</hi> (a name ſo unuſual in that Countrey then) 'twas given him on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Being born, his Father ſent him to be Chriſtened at <hi>Kildare</hi> by <hi>Donachadh</hi> Lord of that Countrey, of purpoſe to let him know by this <hi>Goſſipred</hi> he was reconciled to him:
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:102628:178"/> for before they had been at ſome diſtance: and therefore thoſe that carried the Child were commanded by the Father to Chriſten him <hi>Conchabhar;</hi> this being that Nobleman's ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name who was to be Godfather. But a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, reputed in that Countrey then, ſuch an other as <hi>Merlin</hi> had been of old among the <hi>Brittans,</hi> meeting them in the High-way, charg'd them to call him <hi>Laurence:</hi> aſſuring them he would himſelf that night excuſe them to their Lord; and then adding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically in <hi>Iriſh</hi> Verſe; <hi>This Child ſhall be great on Earth and glorious in Heaven: he ſhall command over great multitudes both of rich and poor, and</hi> Laurence <hi>ſhall be his name.</hi> When he was but ten years old, his Father delivered him an Hoſtage to <hi>Diarmuid</hi> the King of <hi>Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> In which condition, notwithſtanding the innocency of his Age he ſuffer'd incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible miſeries, even to extream want of Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Food, in a deſert place among barbarous people, where he had been for two years confined. At the expiration of which, being return'd back in exchange of other Priſoners, though not delivered to the Father himſelf, but to the Biſhop of <hi>Gleann-da-Logh:</hi> and his Father coming on the twelfth day, not only to ſee him, but to deſire the Biſhop to learn of God by Lot which of his children he ſhould dedicate to an Eccleſiaſtick Life;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:102628:178"/> and he taking this opportunity and telling his Father, That with his leave he himſelf would be that Child: the Father ſurpriz'd with joy, takes him preſently by the right hand; and offers him up perpetually to God in that holy place dedicated to St. <hi>Keuin,</hi> both Cathedral Church and Abbey, the one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by a Biſhop, the other by an Abbot. Where <hi>Laurence</hi> proves in a little time ſo ſingular a proficient in all Virtue, that the Abbot dying, the unanimous conſent both of the Monks and Nobles of the Countrey Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him Abbot, and forc'd him to accept of it in the 25th year of his Age.</p>
               <p>And now it begun to appear more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently what ſpirit he was of. For the more he was honour'd, the more he abaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the ſtricter guard he kept on all his ſenſes, and the more intent he was upon his holy aſcetick Exerciſes. Above all, that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which is the <hi>bond of perfection;</hi> that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which ſhall <hi>never be evacuated,</hi> but after <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> are ended ſhall remain; that Virtue which, by relieving the afflictions of other mortals, makes the Reliever a God to them, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks in his Panegyrick to <hi>Trajan;</hi> Charity, I mean, did at this time ſhew what power ſhe had over the Soul of <hi>Laurence.</hi> He was no ſooner made Abbot, than a general Famine oppreſſing all that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:102628:179"/> Countrey four years continually, he no leſs continually employ'd himſelf in relieving all that were in want, eſpecially the poorer ſort, with corn and cattel, and all the Revenues of his Abbey: Revenues that were very great; yea far ſurpaſſing thoſe of the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick. Nor muſt we admire they ſhould be ſo. It was one of the moſt famous ancient Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdom, founded at firſt by St. <hi>Keuin</hi> (as we call him, but the Iriſh <hi>Ceaghin,</hi> the Latins <hi>Coenginus</hi>) a perſon though illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious for his Royal extraction, yet much more celebrated as well for the admirable auſterity of his Life, as for his manifold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Miracles; which made him after his death be aſſumed Patron both of the Town, Abbey, Cathedral Church and whole Dioceſs of <hi>Gleann-da-Loch,</hi> where he lived and died. Beſides none but Noblemen's children were elected Abbots: and the Noblemen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the whole Dioceſs had by ancient cuſtom their Voices in the election of them as well as the Monks. However the large Revenues of the Abbey as they came ſhort of the neceſſities of the poor in that long and general Famine: ſo they did of the charity of <hi>Laurence;</hi> as may be well concluded out of what follows hereafter.</p>
               <p>Much about the time this Famine had ended; the Biſhop of <hi>Gleann-da-Loch</hi> dying,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:102628:179"/> he was choſen to ſucceed. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the importunity of the Electors, he declined it, though pretending only his un-Canonical Age. Yet ſo he could not ſoon after the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Dublin.</hi> For <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt Archbiſhop of this See being dead, <hi>Laurence</hi> by the unanimous conſent of the Clergy and People of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> ſays <hi>Waraeus,</hi> was elected <note place="margin">Commentar. de Praeſul.

That about eleven years after he built the Choire and Steeple with an other addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of three new Chappels to <hi>Trinity Church</hi> in that City. That in the Year 1179. he went to the General Council held then at <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Alexander</hi> III. That according to the Author of his Life, he was there made Legat of <hi>Ireland</hi> by that Pope: ſoon after return'd back, and exercis'd his Legatin Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>Ireland.</hi> That <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi>

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:102628:181"/> he was conſtantly diſciplin'd (as they call it) by the hands of a familiar Friend, whom he truſted, after he had firſt enjoin'd him to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy all his life.</p>
               <p>He as ſoon begun his abſtinence from all ſorts of fleſh throughout the whole Year; which he continued evermore to his death. On <hi>Fridays,</hi> when he ate, he ate only bread and water: for very often he took neither: and when he did, he commonly temper'd his bread with lye and aſhes. In the forty days of <hi>Lent</hi> he taſted nothing at all but thrice a week the ſame hard fare of bread and water, and now and then a few Herbs. And all that <hi>Quadrageſimal</hi> ſeaſon, at the return of it every year, he retired into a moſt horrid, though holy, Wilderneſs, Saint <hi>Kevin</hi>'s Rock three miles from <hi>Gleann-da loch.</hi> A Rock environ'd on every ſide with dark Woods, beſides a deep Lake of one ſide, encloſing its perpendicular precipice of ſixty Cubits high, whence there is not ſo much as any looking down without horror; and on the other ſide an other precipice too, though but of thirty Cubits in heighth, and by a Ladder aſcendable. Within it is a little Plain, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, Trees, and a Spring. In that ſide of it, which hangs over the Lake; there is a hollow made by St. <hi>Keuin</hi>'s own hands (for ſo the Tradition of that Countrey ſays) that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:102628:181"/> ſerv'd him both for an Oratory to pray in, and repoſitory when he would ſleep. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in this hollow and on this Rock did <hi>Laurence</hi> all alone yearly ſpend thoſe 40 days and 40 nights of <hi>Lent</hi> in ſpiritual Exerciſes converſing only with God: ſeeing no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but only thrice a weck; and then only his own Nephew <hi>Thomas</hi> Abbot of <hi>Gleann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da-loch,</hi> who alone brought him a meals meat of bread each time he came; for the Rock of it ſelf afforded water, as we have ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.

               <p>But as a Biſhop, the Virtues peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the diſcharge of his Paſtoral Duty could not be ſo eaſily conceal'd. They were a great many of them too illuſtrious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous to the eyes of all men. As a Biſhop he obſerv'd in a very excellent manner the Rule of the Apoſtle both to rich and poor. And firſt towards the Rich. For though he continued ſtill ſo abſtemious himſelf, though perpetually ſo ſevere a puniſher of his own body with faſting and other mortifications too; yet as he was notwithſtanding of a moſt comely perſonage and noble preſence, ſo his reception of all perſons of Quality and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that came to his Epiſcopal Table was anſwerably graceful, liberal, ſplendid in all reſpects according to their degrees: variety of the beſt diſhes, and choice withal of the moſt delicate Wines. Beſides he ſat down himſelf ſometimes to entertain them; though feeding but very little, and that on ſome groſſer Diſh; or rather indeed commonly ſeeming only to feed, that nothing ſingular might appear in him. Which was the reaſon too, that although in very deed his drink at theſe entertainments was no other in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than water; yet his Cupbearer had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to daſh it lightly with red, that he might ſeem to drink Wine. Secondly towards the poor. He never miſſed a day without ſeeing

               <p>As a Biſhop he preach'd Repentance conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to the people of that opulent City, who were prodigiouſly immers'd in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, luſt, contentions, rapin, blood-ſhed, and all kind of wickedneſs.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102628:183"/> their Arms, praying their mercy, entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for ſome, ſnatching others from their fury to Chriſtian burial who had their Souls yet panting in their Bodies: and when no more could be done by him in any other kind, giving himſelf wholly now to that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous imitation of <hi>Tobias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As a Biſhop it was that although with great hazard ſtill unto himſelf, yet he uſed that Epiſcopal freedom with the King and his inſulting Commanders, that the Clergy were at laſt permitted their own Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Churches reſtor'd their Books and Ornaments. As a Biſhop, he employ'd in the next place all his compaſſion and all his Revenue (I mean what was left thereof unſeized by the Military men, or undeſtroy'd by fire) yea and all whatever he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from others to relieve the few Survivors of the ſlaughter'd Citizens. His very Bowels did yearn over them; eſpecially thoſe whom he had ſo lately ſeen to flouriſh in all kind of Earthly happineſs; and now ſaw without Houſe to lie in, without Cloaths to cover their nakedneſs, without meat or drink to preſerve life, without other comfort than that of miſerable Captives under a moſt deadly Foe.</p>
               <p>As a Biſhop, when an other general Famin had in his days lien heavy on all the Land,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102628:184"/> he not only gave daily ſuſtenance for three whole years to five hundred perſons, reduced before to the worſt of conditions, plain ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; but in ſeveral parts of his Dioceſs provided meat, and drink and cloaths, and all other neceſſaries for three hundred more. And in the ſame cruel ſeaſon of ſcarcity it was that, Mothers reduced to extream want, laying their chriſom Babes in the night at his door, and in the day alſo where ever they ſaw he was to paſs, he took care of them all, providing Nurſes from them; and, though two hundred in number at one time, ſent them to his own Stewards and Bayliſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As a Biſhop, and a Legat too ſays the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his Life, he conniv'd at no diſorder in the Clergy, no vice, no ſin, and leaſt of all at the ſcandalous one of Incontinency whether in Prieſt, Deacon, or ſub-Deacon. Which fleſhly Vice he did ſo much abominate, eſpecially in them, and found it ſo neceſſary to be proceeded againſt with vigour: that even ſo great a number as a hundred and forty Prieſts convict thereof he ſent together at one time for Penance and Abſolution to <hi>Rome;</hi> though
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102628:184"/> he might otherwiſe have given them both at home by his own Authority.</p>
               <p>As a Biſhop, yea as a Father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in general, he ſpent the little remainder as well of his Revenue as of his health and Life in croſſing the Seas now again from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> in both Countreys, following and ſolliciting peace from <hi>Henry</hi> II. to eaſe the common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of his Nation at this time.</p>

               <p>Now that ſuch a life, and ſuch a death of a man ſo virtuous all along from his very Youth, whether he be conſidered either as a Clerk, or Monk, or Abbot of <hi>Gleann-da-Loch,</hi> or as Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and <hi>Chanon</hi> of the <hi>Aroaſian</hi> Inſtitute, or as Legat of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or as a proſperous or afflicted man, ſhould be atteſted as pleaſing to God by prodigious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles both in his life and after his death, ſeems nothing ſtrange to me. The Author of his Life recounts a good many of them wrought in the time of his Life. And the Bull of his canonization (dated at <hi>Reate</hi> III. <hi>Ides Decemb.</hi> by <hi>Honorius</hi> III. Ninth year of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:102628:186"/> his Pontificat, which was of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 1225.) gives a brief ſum of all (that had been wrought either in his Life or after his death) by telling us, That beſides the Dumb, and Lame, and Lepers, and many others afflicted with ſundry other maladies, cur'd of all their evils at the ſole invocation of God by him, or in his name, and at his Tomb by others: he was, by the power of God, the wonderful raiſer e'en from death to life of ſeven perſons in particular, and among 'em of one who had been full three days dead. Nor can I well deny that this Bull ought to have by much the more credit with many who are not in other matters over-credulous, and ought ſo to have for theſe reaſons: 1. Becauſe it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and the whole ceremony and proceſs of this canonization ſollicited, not only by the Letters of the Archbiſhop and Chapter of <hi>Roan,</hi> and of the Abbot and Convent of the foreſaid <hi>Auge,</hi> where the body then reſted within the Dioceſs of <hi>Roan,</hi> but by thoſe alſo of many other Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots and religious men: all atteſting the ſanctity of his Life and glory of Miracles continually wrought after his death at his Tomb. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Inquiſition was made partly in <hi>France</hi> by the Archbiſhop, Dean and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of <hi>Roan,</hi> and for the reſt in <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Biſhop of <hi>Kildare</hi> and Prior of <hi>Trinity
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:102628:186"/> Church</hi> in <hi>Dublin.</hi> 3. Becauſe within 45 years after his death all was finiſh'd, and this very Bull iſſued, and his Feſtivity with an Octave kept in the moſt ſolemn manner could be, both at <hi>Auge</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and at <hi>Dublin</hi> and elſewhere in <hi>Ireland,</hi> while the people were yet alive, nay by a world of thoſe very people of all degrees that knew and converſed with him familiarly, and yet invoked him now moſt devoutly and religiouſly as Coheir of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in glory, and their tutelary Patron un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Chriſt</hi> with God the Father.</p>
               <p>The fifth and laſt Point is, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the ſanctity and merits either of thoſe two extraordinary Wonder-working Saints of God, <hi>Malachy</hi> and <hi>Laurence,</hi> or of any other holy men whatſoever, that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret mourned for the iniquities of their People; that cried to God inceſſantly to ſpare them; and that in the Language of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> interpos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <note place="margin">Ezech.

                  <hi>a hedg</hi> between the wrath of Heaven and their Land, by faſting and praying, and afflicting their own Bodies for the ſins of others, yet all would not do. It was now come to that paſs with the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> in general, which had been with the People of <hi>Judaea,</hi> when God ſpake to <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> the Prophet, (c.

It was come to that very paſs with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> now, in which it had been again with the ſame ſtubborn ſtiffnecked <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> when he declar'd to the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi> and ſware unto him even by his own Life, That <hi>if thoſe very three</hi> (moſt perfect ſervants of his in their generation) <hi>Moſes, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> lived among them: yet <hi>by their righteouſneſs they ſhould only ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> not any other, no not ſo much as <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son or Daughter.</hi> For ſuch indeed was the deplorable caſe of the ancient <hi>Mileſians</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> at this time, the very laſt period of their Monarchy. And ſuch it was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo many juſt men, as in particular the Biſhops <hi>Malchus,</hi> and <hi>Gilbertus,</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianus</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> and <hi>Malachi</hi> and <hi>Laurence,</hi> that lived among them and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded for them continually to God. Yea, ſuch it was notwithſtanding all the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſo lately wrought by any of theſe holy men, among either Eccleſiaſticks or Laics any where in the Nation, and all the Councils held, and all the Monaſteries built, and Schools erected, and Churches endowed, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102628:187"/> elſe at this time was practis'd to reſtore both civility and piety to ſome degree of the ancient Luſtre. Nothing at all could any longer ſlow the execution of the final doom pronounced by the <hi>Watcher</hi> and <hi>holy one of Heaven</hi> againſt the lofty proud <hi>Mileſian</hi> Tree. Nor muſt we wonder at it, if we reflect upon what is diſcours'd at large in the former Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The Kings, and Princes, and Nobles, and Men at Arms of <hi>Ireland,</hi> either all this while were not at all themſelves reformed: or certainly, and that moſt frequently too, were again relapſed into their old accurſed Feuds, their concuſſions, violences, rapin, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, revenge, their ſpilling of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood to death: and this even all along, from time to time, until the Executioners of their final Sentence came to part them, and make them for ever ſlaves on every ſide to a forein People.</p>
               <p>What other ſins of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation might (according to the judgment of man) have incenſed God, after ſo long forbearance, to pour upon 'em ſo dreadful a judgment, I cannot ſay. And the reaſon is, becauſe I find no ſpecification of any other in thoſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of theirs which I have read. Yet, I will not paſs over in ſilence, what I find to this purpoſe in <hi>Girald</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> (I mean <hi>Cambrenſis.</hi>) This Author ſays, that upon
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:102628:188"/> the taking of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and harraſing of <hi>Meath</hi> by <hi>Diarmuid na-Ngall</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter</hi> and his forein Auxiliaries: the Clergy of <hi>Ireland</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in a National Synod at <hi>Ardmach,</hi> having debated the cauſes of this Invaſion: and after full debate, reſolved firſt in general, that the ſins of their Nation had brought this calamity on them: Secondly, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, That their evil cuſtom of buying <hi>Chriſtian Engliſh</hi> Youths, as well from Merchants as Pirats, and making them ſlaves for ever, had been a ſpecial Cauſe of it: Thirdly, That God was juſt in ſubjecting their People to the ſame condition of ſlavery under that very Nation which they had ſo unchriſtianly uſed: it was therefore in the laſt place unanimouſly decreed, That immediately all <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſlaves whereſoever throughout the whole Kingdom ſhould be manumiſed, and ſet at full Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So ſays <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> in his Firſt Book <hi>de Expug. Hibern.</hi> c. 28. Where he further ſays, That the People of <hi>England, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Saxons,</hi> while their Kingdom flouriſh'd before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, had this vitious cuſtom among them generally, That rather than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any the leaſt want, they ſet their children to publick ſale, and ſent both children and Couſins too over Seas to be ſold in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And then he gives his own judgment on the whole, concluding, It may be probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:102628:188"/> That as God in his Juſtice had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready puniſh'd with ſervitude under a forein Yoak the <hi>Saxon</hi> Sellers, ſo the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Buyers were juſtly fallen at this time into the like ſeverity of Gods avenging wrath.</p>
               <p>But whether alſo that horrible violation of the Sanctuary of God for fifteen Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and the moſt hideous corruption of Manners flowing thence, and overflowing well nigh the whole Kingdom: whereof we have ſeen before ſo much out of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> might not be another ſpecial and peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more exaſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rating cauſe? Or whether the exemplary puniſhment fallen ſo ſuddenly under <hi>Malachias</hi> upon the whole Race of thoſe neſarious men, that for ſo long were the chief Authors of that ſacriledg and corruption, did, or did not ſatisfie the Juſtice of God as to that matter? And whether the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation wrought by <hi>Malachias</hi> in his own days, continued any while after his death? Nay whether ſo great a number of incontinent Prieſts, within ſo little a time of his death, and under the ſuperintendency of ſo bleſſed a man as St. <hi>Laurence</hi> was, might not argue a third or fourth ſpecial motive? Or whether at leaſt, it might not evince a very juſt ground to ſuſpect e'en a very great Apoſtacy among the Clergy themſelves in ſome places, and by conſequence a much greater a-mong thepeople in the ſame places, from that holy Reform of them by
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:102628:189"/> 
                  <hi>Malachias?</hi> I muſt confeſs, I know not what to anſwer theſe Queres; as being for one part of them enveloped in the darkneſs of God's ſecret determinations: and for the reſt, or matter of Fact, obſervable by man, paſt over without any mention of it in Hiſtory. Only this I can with much probability aver, That they are much out, who, grounding themſelves on that number of Prieſts convict of Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency by St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> would thence conclude, this of Incontinency to have been a general Vice infecting the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergy and People of <hi>Ireland</hi> at this time, and conſequently one of the ſpecial cauſes that brought the heavieſt of their judgments, <hi>The Engliſh Conqueſt,</hi> upon them. 1. <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> (p. 319.) tells us, <q>That <hi>Albinus O Moliny,</hi> Abbot firſt of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinglaſs,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Ferns</hi> (under <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> II. when <hi>Laurence</hi> was Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and thoſe Prieſts convict) in a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sermon of his, treating at large of the continency of Clerks, and inveighing bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly as to that point, againſt the wicked Example given by thoſe <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eccleſiaſticks come to <hi>Ireland</hi> with <hi>Fitz-Steven, Strongbow,</hi> &amp;c. declared in very ample manner how extraordinary pure the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergy had been before they mix'd with thoſe Foreiners, and were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by their Example.</q> 2. <hi>Cambrenſis</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:102628:189"/> himſelf, how unfavourable ſoever he be in other matters to that Nation, is (in his <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pography, diſt. 3. c.</hi> xxvii.) a witneſs beyond exception, as of other great Virtues, ſo in particular of the Chaſtity of their Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks. <hi>Eſt autem terrae iſtius Clerus ſatis Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gione commendabilis: &amp; inter varias quibus pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let virtutes, caſtitatis praerogativa praeeminet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que praecellit. The Clergy of that Land,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as to Religion are commendable enough: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their many Virtues, Chaſtity has in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent degree the prerogative of all.</hi> And then he goes on telling their aſſiduity in reading and praying, and ſinging Pſalms, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the precincts of their Churches and Abbeys, and never taſting any thing all day until they had ended <hi>Completorium,</hi> or <hi>Complin,</hi> as they call it, the very laſt of the canonical Hours, in the dusk of the Evening. 'Tis true, he cenſures their indulging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at night more freely both in meat and drink. But it is withal no leſs true, That therefore he wonders at their Chaſtity: hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for <hi>a Miracle</hi> that Wine and <hi>Venus</hi> ſhould not meet.</p>
               <p>And yet after all, I know not what to think of his charging them ſo grievouſly in theſe two particulars. 1. That (<hi>inter tot millia vix unum invenies,</hi> &amp;c.) among ſo many Thouſands, ſcarce one might be found that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:102628:190"/> notwithſtanding their continual inſtance in praying and faſting all day, did not at night enormouſly exceed in Wine and other drinks. 2d. That albeit their Biſhops, as having been generally aſſumed out of Monaſteries, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd moſt diligently all the duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Monks: for according to the ancient cuſtom they even after their aſſumption to the Epiſcopal Order, continued ſtill their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode within the precincts of their Abbeys, wholly given to Prayer and contemplation: yet withal they no leſs wholly neglected preaching to their people, or inveighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wickedneſs, or uſing the ſeverity of Epiſcopal diſciplin to extirpate their Vices, and plant thoſe Virtues in their ſtead which became Chriſtian Profeſſors. And indeed, if <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> as he is often in other matters of <hi>Ireland,</hi> be not extreamly out, or extreamly byaſſed, in theſe particulars, eſpecially the ſecond of them: we may peradventure juſtly conceive, that here is an other ſpecial cauſe of that very heavieſt of Gods judgments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending at this time over the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>But whatever may be thought to have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been or not been any of the ſpecial cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and although, as I ought ſo I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that not even my own ſuppoſition all along hitherto, <hi>viz. of their mortal Feuds and bloodſhed among themſelves to have been their
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:102628:190"/> greateſt, moſt ſpecial and moſt peculiar provocation of Heaven,</hi> muſt be obtruded on the Reader as a certainty; but only repreſented to him as the moſt probable and pious conjecture that may be grounded as well on the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical predictions of the <hi>Iriſh Saints,</hi> as upon the nature and merit of things in themſelves, taken as they are recorded ſo fully and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in Doctor <hi>Ketings</hi> Hiſtory: yet I may confidently affirm, they were in general very great and very grievous and enormous ſins, without queſtion, either of the Clergy, or People, or their Biſhops, or of their Kings, Princes, Nobles and other men of War, or of all together, that brought ſo heavy, ſo ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting a judgment on that Nation as to their Being in this World. For although parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons have been ſometimes grievouſly afflicted only for the trial of their Virtue; as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Tobias:</hi> ſometimes only for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Power and Works of God, without any demerit of theirs, or their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents either; as the <hi>Blind Man</hi> in the Goſpel: never has a whole Nation or Kingdom been deſtroy'd but for the enormity of their ſins. Whereof whoever pleaſes may ſee proofs at large in <hi>Fitz-Herberts Policy and Religion,</hi> Part 1. chap. 21. 22. 23, &amp;c. yea <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Syrach,</hi> for he may be more eaſily conſulted in every Bible at hand, may give to a ſober
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:102628:191"/> man aſſurance enough, where he ſays, Firſt (<hi>cap.</hi> 10. 8.) that <hi>the Kingdom is tranſlated from Nation to Nation, becauſe of unjuſt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, injuries, calumnies, and various deceits.</hi> Secondly, (<hi>c.</hi> 40. 10.) that <hi>death and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſtrife, and the ſword, oppreſſion, famine, contrition and ſcourges, were all of them created for the wicked, and for them the deluge was made.</hi> Nay, if we conſult the Books of Kings, read the Prophets, run over the Books of <hi>Joſuah, Judges, Deuteronomy, Chronicles,</hi> and the reſt of the old Teſtament, examine all the Hiſtories of Chriſtendom: we ſhall not find any whole Kingdom or Nation deſtroy'd but for grievous and horrible ſins either of the Rulers, or People, or Prieſts, or all together. Yea, we ſhall commonly find the very qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſpecies of thoſe tranſgreſſions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that brought the vengeance on them. However, and notwithſtanding that further yet we know, that bloodſhed is one of thoſe four ſins that cry to Heaven <note place="margin">Gen. X. 11.</note> for vengeance: <hi>the Voice of thy brothers blood cries to me from the earth,</hi> ſaid God himſelf to <hi>Cain:</hi> and that the very ſecond of the <note place="margin">Gen. IX. 6.</note> Laws he gave to <hi>Noe</hi> was, that <hi>whoſoever did ſhed the blood of man, his alſo ſhould be ſhed:</hi> after all, I dare not affirm poſitively that either
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:102628:191"/> thoſe very Feuds of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> how unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd ſoever in blood, or thoſe other tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> be they what you pleaſe, were the ſins that moved God to pronounce this final doom againſt them; but only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, That their great ſins compell'd him to it. And how ſhould I indeed? For, <hi>who was the Counſellor</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay XL. 13. Rom. XI. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>of God?</hi> or who knows any thing of the ſecrets of his Providence, except only thoſe to whom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was pleaſed to reveal them.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs I dare acquaint the Reader, that although I give but little credit general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſometimes none at all, to the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> where he ſeems rather to vent his paſſion and write a Satyr againſt that People, than regard either Modeſty or Truth; yet I will not call in queſtion what he relates (<hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Expug. Hib. c.</hi> 33.) of the Prophetical predictions, made ſo many Ages before, by the four Prophetical Saints of that Nation, <hi>Moling, Brachan, Patrick</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumb-Cille,</hi> and <hi>written by themſelves</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in their own Iriſh Books extant yet in Ireland,</hi> concerning the final Fate of their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the old <hi>Mileſian</hi> Race. <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That the people of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> ſhall not only invade them, but for many Ages continue a ſharp, cruel, and yet doubtful War upon
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:102628:192"/> them at home in <hi>Ireland:</hi> ſometimes the one, and ſometimes the other ſide prevailing. That although thoſe Invaders ſhall be often diſturb'd, worſted, weakned, eſpecially (and according to the prophecy of <hi>Brachan</hi>) by a certain King that ſhall come from the deſert Mountains of <hi>Patrick,</hi> and on a <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-night</hi> ſeize a Caſtle in the Woody parts of <hi>Ibh Faohlain,</hi> and beſides force them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all away out of <hi>Ireland:</hi> yet they ſhall continually maintain the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Sea-Coaſt in their poſſeſſion. That, in fine, it will be no ſooner than a little before the day of judgment, and then it will be, when they ſhall be throughly and univerſally victorious over all <hi>Ireland;</hi> erect Caſtles every where among the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and reduce the whole Iſland from Sea to Sea under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Yoak.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And verily thoſe Prophetical predictions, five hundred years ſince delivered us by <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brenſis</hi> as he received 'em from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves, are the more obſervable, That by conſulting the Hiſtory of after-Ages from <hi>Henry</hi> II. of <hi>England</hi> to the laſt of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> and firſt of King <hi>James,</hi> we may ſee them to a tittle accompliſh'd.

               <p>But whether from this <hi>Iriſh</hi> Propheſie, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had, as for the ſubſtance, not the exact words of it from <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> for he pretends not to give to us the exact words: or had perhaps, at leaſt for ſome part of it, from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves reſorting to <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe days: the famous <hi>Italian</hi> Prophet of <hi>Calabria, Joachimus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Flore,</hi> did foretell in his time the utter deſtruction, and eternal deſolation that <note place="margin">

                  <hi>of Monmouth</hi> in his ſeven Books of Hiſtory, and out of him by others. Only (beſides my ſumming up the number of Kings, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the period of times, and contracting the whole ſtory, and digeſting it into this order and Method) give me leave to except the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> King's thirty Daughters, and the <hi>Incubi</hi> Devils, with their Gigantic procreation.

               </p>
               <p>45. But as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Newbery</hi> (commonly called in Latin, <hi>Neubrigenſis</hi>) this <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s own Contemporary in <hi>England,</hi> has (in <hi>Proe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio Hiſtor.</hi>) five hundred years ſince reflected with much freedom and tartneſs on the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, incredibility, and falſity of his Hiſtory in general, and more particularly on that part of it which repreſents King <hi>Arthur</hi> ſuch a wonderful Heroe: ſo has in later times <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore Virgil</hi> firſt, and after him <hi>George Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> ruin'd the very foundation of the whole Fabrick; I mean, the very Being or Exiſtence of <hi>Brute</hi> himſelf at any time on Earth. And certainly, in my opinion, the reaſons of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore</hi> ſeem convincing enough to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſs'd man. For, ſays he <hi>l. 2. Hiſtor. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glic.</hi>) neither <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> nor <hi>Dionyſius Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licarnaſſeus,</hi> nor any of thoſe other Authors
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:102628:208"/> that moſt diligently write of <hi>Roman</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have one ſyllable of this <hi>Brutus.</hi> Nor could any thing concerning ſo much as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Name or Exiſtence be fetch'd from the ancient Annals of <hi>Great Brittain:</hi> ſeeing that five hundred years, or thereabouts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this new Hiſtory of <hi>Galfridus</hi> had been contriv'd, <hi>Gildas</hi> (I mean the true, and not the ſuppoſititious one) complain'd, that if ever the ancient <hi>Britons</hi> his Countrey-men, had any ſuch or other <hi>Annals</hi> at all, they were undoubtedly either periſh'd in the War at home, or carried away ſo far abroad as no news could be had of them. Beſides, the particular of the taking of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Belinus</hi> and <hi>Brennus</hi> quite over-throws all both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick and foundation of this New Hiſtory, if we compute the times ſet down in it, and compare them with thoſe in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Chronicles. For in this New Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not only <hi>Brute</hi> is ſaid to have conquer'd <hi>Albion</hi> about the tenth year after his Father <hi>Silvius</hi> had been kill'd, which was the year of the World 4100; but the two Brothers <hi>Belinus</hi> and <hi>Brennus</hi> (ſons to <hi>Molmutius</hi> the XX. King, and they the XXI. Generation from <hi>Brute</hi>) are ſaid to have taken <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four hundred years after the ſame <hi>Brute</hi> had conquer'd this Iſland. And yet accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Epitome or account of times both
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:102628:208"/> in <hi>Euſebius</hi> and all other as well <hi>Greek</hi> as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Hiſtories, <hi>Rome</hi> was taken by <hi>Brennus</hi> and his <hi>Gauls</hi> even after full ſeven hundred years and ten had been over from the foreſaid year wherein <hi>Brute</hi> is ſaid by the new Hiſtory to have enter'd <hi>Albion.</hi> So that by this new Hiſtory <hi>Brennus</hi> muſt have taken <hi>Rome</hi> three hundred and ten years before it was really ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at all. Then which, I think, nothing can be deſired more convincing to ruin both the Fabrick and foundation of this Romance of <hi>Brute.</hi> And ſo in effect has <hi>Polydors</hi> thought before me.</p>
               <p>But if you would have more, yea many more unanſwerable arguments on this Subject: you may conſult <hi>George Buchanan</hi> where he has them at large, <hi>L. 2. Hiſtor. Scot.</hi> For, as it ought to be no part of my purpoſe here to compare or confront ſo many, or indeed any of thoſe vain particulars in the new Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Brute,</hi> either with the Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Annals</hi> and Hiſtory of <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or his Life of <hi>Agricola,</hi> or Venerable <hi>Bedes</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronology publiſh'd by <hi>Wheloc,</hi> or the moſt ancient Monuments of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or any other ſacred or profane of ſo many other Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> or with Reaſon it ſelf: ſo it is neither any part of it, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or give thoſe manifold arguments of

                  <hi>Buchanan,</hi> though they be directly home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very foundation of the ſame new Hiſtory, or the Being or Exiſtence at any time of <hi>Brute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſufficeth me in this place to have given the reaſons of <hi>Polydore</hi> againſt it. My purpoſe here being no other, than (in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the above paſſage in my <hi>eighth</hi> and <hi>ninth page</hi>) to conclude out of all, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cronologers and Hiſtorians <hi>have at leaſt much more probability</hi> on their ſide in aſſerting unanimouſly that their true <hi>Briotan</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of <hi>Nemedus,</hi> and planted a Colony in the North part of this great Iſland ſo early, was he that gave the whole Iſland the denomination of <hi>Brittain</hi> from his own name, than they on the other ſide have, who, if the arguments hitherto be concluſive, tell us in effect, that a falſe and forged <hi>Brutus,</hi> one that never was in Being ſhould have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it.</p>
               <p>And indeed, the Authority of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monuments in the <hi>Pſalter of Caſhel,</hi> an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Book of <hi>Iriſh Hiſtories,</hi> written above eight hundred years ſince by ſo great and knowing and holy a man as <hi>Cormack;</hi> who was at the ſame time both King and Biſhop of <hi>Mounſter:</hi> and the further derivation of the more remote Antiquities inſerted in it from that other Book much more ancient yet,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:102628:209"/> which above one thouſand two hundred years ſince, in the compoſing or collecting of it out of all the former Chronicles of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the very firſt Plantations of it, had been, in the Parliament or National Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of all the Eſtates at <hi>Tarach</hi> under <hi>Laogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Monarch, ſuperviſed and agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the choiceſt Committee they could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point of three Antiquaries, three Kings and three Biſhops, whereof S. <hi>Patrick</hi> himſelf was one; over-ballances by much the credit of <hi>Geof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> of <hi>Menmouth</hi> in his new Hiſtory of <hi>Brutus,</hi> written by him no earlier than <hi>Henry</hi> II.

               <p>Which notwithſtanding, and whatever elſe I have given any where in this <hi>Reflection,</hi> on my own foreſaid eighth and ninth <hi>page,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire may be underſtood by the Reader, as I intended it, <hi>i. e.</hi> without any prejudice or diminution of the great and known both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and bravery of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Nation, whenceſoever they have truly derived the name of <hi>Brittons</hi> for themſelves, or that of <hi>Brittain</hi> for their Countrey. Of the former, I mean their Antiquity, <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> is a witneſs beyond exception, where he ſpeaks in his <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> (L. v.) of the inland people of <hi>Brittain,</hi> as if they had been <hi>Aborigenes,</hi> without any derivation from elſewhere abroad; <hi>quos na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos

Of the later, both <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Beda,</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters no leſs unexceptionable, have recorded to Poſterity very conſiderable Inſtances. The one, in his <hi>Annals</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Agricola</hi>'s <hi>Life,</hi> telling their fierce Fights, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their ſucceſſes too againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals, in their own Countrey <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> The other, in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> acknowledging ſeveral great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories had by them both in the ſame Iſland their own Countrey over his Countreymen the <hi>Saxons</hi> that invaded them; nay, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly telling us (in the 16th <hi>chap.</hi> of his <hi>Firſt Book</hi>) of two very ſpecial Victories, the firſt under the leading of <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius,</hi> the ſecond in <hi>Black more</hi> about that place, where <hi>Scarborough Caſtle</hi> is now, called by <hi>Polidore</hi> in his Hiſtory <hi>Mons Badonicus:</hi> adding withal, that after the firſt overthrow given by them, although ſometimes worſted, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the War with great reſolution, worſting alſo not ſeldom their Foes, until at laſt they hem'd them in about the ſaid Hill or Mountain <hi>Badonicus,</hi> and made a mighty ſlaughter of them there. Which happened, ſays <hi>Bede</hi> in the forty fourth year after the firſt landing of the <hi>Saxons.</hi> Above all, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence made by the Reliques of them in <hi>Wales,</hi> after their Kingdom had been utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:102628:210"/> upon <hi>Cadwallador</hi>'s withdrawing to <hi>France,</hi> yea made and continued by them for ſeven hundred years, and their fighting ſo long for their Liberty, againſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> firſt, and <hi>Normans</hi> after, till they obtain'd honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Conditions at laſt from <hi>Edward</hi> I. are ſufficient arguments of their Martial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and brave Souls, however Fortune frown'd upon them.</p>
               <p>And as I ought to be ſo ingenuous in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging what I have now done concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Nation in general: ſo likewiſe, in reference to <hi>Jeffry</hi> himſelf, I will be ſo juſt as to acknowledg what he ſays of the hand of God that lay ſo heavy upon them at laſt, even to their utter deſtruction, by the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Feuds and cruel Famine, and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of all the Peſtilence that follow'd.

               <p>45. In my 13. <hi>page</hi> I ſpake ſomewhat of the cauſes moving the eight ſons of <hi>Mileſius,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, to think ſeriouſly of invading <hi>Ireland.</hi> But I might have added, How their conſultation about this matter was held in <hi>Breoghuin</hi>'s Tower in <hi>Gallicia.</hi> How it was from thence they employ'd <hi>Ith</hi> (or <hi>Ithius</hi>) their Uncle on the Father's ſide (as being ſon to <hi>Breoghuin</hi> their great Grandfather) in a ſhip well provided, and man'd with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty ſtout Soldiers, to diſcover the ſtate of <hi>Ireland.</hi> How <hi>Ith</hi> having landed in <hi>Mounſter,</hi> and there underſtood that <hi>Cearma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s three ſons, who as three Kings ruled <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> alternatively, were together at <hi>Oileach Neidh</hi> in the North, but at ſome difference among themſelves about the Jewels of their Anceſtors, went thither by Land, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a hundred of his men; the ſhip failing about with the reſt to meet him there. How being come to <hi>Oileach,</hi> and honourably received by the ſons of <hi>Cearmada,</hi> and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a ſtranger and conſequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their diſpute, being choſen Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator of it, he decided their quarrel to all their ſatisfaction: firſt by dividing the Jewels equally betwixt them: and then exhorting them to mutual love and peace: adding withal very much in praiſe of their delightſom plentiful Countrey. How when he had taken
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:102628:211"/> leave of them to return to his ſhip for <hi>Spain,</hi> the eldeſt of the Three reflecting on the high praiſes he gave the Land, and fearing his deſign ſhould be to bring others to invade them, breaks his jealouſie to the other two, and with their conſent and ſome armed Troops purſues <hi>Ith,</hi> overtakes him, fights him, routs his men, wounds himſelf deadly, and leaves him in that condition of a dead man grovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Earth at a place called from that Fight and his Name <hi>Magh Ith.</hi> How the few ſurvivers of his men headed by his own ſon carried away his body a ſhipboard, where he died of his wounds; but they neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs arrived in <hi>Spain,</hi> and coming to their Couſins the eighth Brothers, expoſed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all, of purpoſe to excite and haſten their revenge. And in the laſt place, how that although as well theſe as thoſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the <hi>Mileſians</hi> in general, and their Couſins and adherents made this killing, or this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (which you pleaſe to call it) commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the ſaid <hi>Ithius</hi> and his men, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their Invaſion and War, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of the juſtice of their quarrel, and following Conqueſt of that Countrey by them: yet the whole Hiſtory makes it plain, That 'twas no other indeed but a meer pretence: being <hi>Ithius</hi> went thither as a meer Spy to diſcover the Countrey: and that they were

               <p>46. In the mean while, and in this very place, the Reader will give me leave to obſerve a thing that may prevent ſome queſtion or ſome admiration about the ſons of <hi>Cearma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> chuſing <hi>Ithius</hi> their Arbitrator.

                  <hi>Ciocal</hi> and his followers deſcended from the accurſed <hi>Cham,</hi> and come out of <hi>Africk,</hi> had another peculiar Language of their own.</p>
               <p>57.

I am ſure none could juſtly do ſo, that pleas'd to conſider what I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>page 5. viz.</hi> That the <hi>Mileſians</hi> had not before two hundred eighty three years after <hi>Moſes</hi>'s paſſing the <hi>Red</hi> Sea landed in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For until then, whatever they were called, it is plain they could not be called <hi>Iriſh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this name they derived from that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland where they never lived before this time. And 'tis no leſs plain that before this time the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had, as a free and brave and conquering Nation, inhabited <hi>Paleſtin,</hi> at leaſt two hundred and forty years: had alſo lived forty years in the Wilderneſs: and before that too, had been a great numerous people in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they lived in all, from the deſcent of <hi>Jacob</hi> out of <hi>Canaan</hi> thither, till their departure under <hi>Moſes,</hi> through the <hi>Red</hi> Sea, two hundred and fifteen years, (as <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>

And therefore to them or their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientneſs I could not intend to compare that of the <hi>Mileſians,</hi> nor as now become <hi>Iriſh,</hi> no nor as <hi>Gathelians</hi> neither. For <hi>Gathelus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the original ſtock of all the <hi>Gathelians,</hi> and conſequently of the <hi>Mileſtans,</hi> being theſe were only a branch of thoſe, was but a youth in <hi>Egypt</hi> with his Father <hi>Niull</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> croſs'd the <hi>Red</hi> Sea, as we have lately ſeen at large.</p>

               <p>51. With the Battel, or loſs, or name of <hi>Coilus,</hi> as King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> mention'd by me <hi>page</hi> 19. though I took it from <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> and quoted <hi>Buchanan,</hi> as he does, and find by reading <hi>Buchanan</hi> himſelf, that <hi>Keting</hi> has rightly quoted him; yet now I am not my ſelf otherwiſe affected with it than to reject it utterly. And my reaſon is, not only <hi>Buchanans</hi> fixing the time of that Battel, fought, as he ſays, between <hi>Coilus</hi> King of the <hi>Brittons</hi> and <hi>Fergus</hi> I. King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> eight or nine hundred years before this very <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> came from <hi>Ireland:</hi> nor only <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s borrowing this whole ſtory out of <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> whom <hi>Humphry Lloyd</hi> calls <hi>hominem impuriſſimum,</hi> a moſt impure Author, and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, Scriptorem corruptiſſimum,</hi> a moſt corrupt Writer, nay one who in the far greater part of his Hiſtory ſcarce delivers any truth at all: but the very name of <hi>Coilus</hi> here, deriving its original from the fertil invention of <hi>Geof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s new Hiſtory of <hi>Brutus.</hi> For it is only in this Romance we find the firſt mention of any <hi>Coilus</hi> among the Kings of <hi>Great Brittain.</hi> And there indeed, I muſt confeſs, we have not only one, but three Monarchs of this Iſland bearing that name. The firſt of them being the fortieth King, in order of time; the ſecond, being the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth ſecond King; and the laſt, whom he names
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:102628:215"/> 
                  <hi>Coel.</hi> being the ſeventy ninth, according to <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s diſpoſition of them and my account out of him. But I muſt withal acknowledg, that he has not a word nor a ſyllable either of the firſt or laſt of theſe Three, ſave only the bare names of <hi>Coilus</hi> and <hi>Coel,</hi> hudled in among ſo many other moſtly too bare names of other pretended <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Kings. Neither has he any more of the very Second <hi>Coilus</hi> than that he was the ſon of King <hi>Marius,</hi> and the Father of King <hi>Lucius</hi> the <hi>Firſt Chriſtian</hi> King of <hi>Great Brittain:</hi> and that having in his youth been bred at <hi>Rome,</hi> he continued after, e'en all along his Reign, both devoted to the <hi>Roman</hi> State, and in Peace with all his Neighbours. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt of the ſtory in <hi>Buchanan,</hi> either of this or any other <hi>Coilus,</hi> muſt be a later additional Invention: and, in reference to the real true Records of Antiquity, as ill contrived as might be; though anſwerably enough to the foundation laid for ſuch a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure of the new Hiſtory of <hi>Brute</hi> and his Deſcendants.</p>
               <p>But ſince we are occaſionally return'd again to this famed Work of <hi>Galfridus Monume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis,</hi> whereof you have elſewhere ſo lately had from my own reading it over a pretty juſt Summary; give me leave here to let you ſee out of others as juſt a cenſure of it. Give
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:102628:215"/> me leave to tell you, that <hi>Alanus Copus</hi> has compared it with <hi>Ovids Metamorphoſis</hi> and <hi>Lucians</hi> Tales. That <hi>William Neubrigenſis</hi> has ſpent even three whole Leaves (in <hi>Prooem. Hiſt.</hi>) to demonſtrate by inſtance of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, how it is wholly compos'd of the moſt improbable, incredible, and ungrounded Lyes that ever were invented. That <hi>Cambden</hi> alſo in his <hi>Britannia</hi> relates to others, who ſtick not to ſay, it is all patch'd up of untunable diſcords and jarring abſurdities; yea, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of ſuch <hi>Mileſian</hi> Fables, ſuch intolerable meer inventions of the Authors own brain, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church at laſt thought fit to enroll it in the <hi>Index</hi> of <hi>Prohibited Books.</hi> Yea that <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> himſelf, though a <hi>Britton</hi> by birth and blood, and as deſirous of the glory of his Countrey-men as any could be, gives it nevertheleſs the Character of a <hi>fabulous Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory;</hi> as you may ſee in his <hi>Deſcription of Wales,</hi> cap. 7. Nay that in his <hi>Itinerary of Wales,</hi> l. 1. c. 5. he tells us that, and the occaſion and manner how, the Devils were ſeen leaping and skipping and dancing on it.</p>
               <p>However, and though it be manifeſt, that as well theſe Cenſures, as the Summary afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, are ſufficient, even each of them apart, to ruin the ſtory of <hi>Coilus</hi> and <hi>Fergus</hi> in <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan,</hi> which derives originally from <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fridus,</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:102628:216"/> and ultimately relies on his invention: I ſhall nevertheleſs give now another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhewing more peculiarly, how little Faith ought to be given him in his Catalogue of <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Kings, and conſequently none at all to his naming of <hi>Coilus</hi> among them. In his Seventh Book, Chap. V. where he ſo confidently relates the mighty Battel fought and overthrow given by King <hi>Arthur</hi> in <hi>France</hi> to thoſe four hundred thouſand <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and their Auxiliaries, mentioned before, part <hi>Europeans,</hi> part <hi>Aſians,</hi> and the reſt <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans,</hi> under many Kings come to aſſiſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour againſt <hi>Arthur:</hi> he has alſo the brazen brow to invent not only thoſe three names of the Emperour himſelf and his two Lieutenant Generals, which we have ſeen before; but many more of the Auxiliary Kings: <hi>viz. Epiſtrephus</hi> King of <hi>Greece, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemphar</hi> King of <hi>Parthia, Aliafatina</hi> King of <hi>Spain, Hirtacus</hi> King of <hi>Affric, Boetus</hi> King of the <hi>Medes, Sextorius</hi> King of <hi>Libya, Teucer</hi> King of <hi>Phrygia, Xerxes</hi> King of the <hi>Itureans, Pandraſus</hi> King of <hi>Egypt, Miſipſa</hi> King of <hi>Babylon, Politetes</hi> Duke of <hi>Bithynia, Teucer</hi> Duke of <hi>Phrygia, Evander</hi> of <hi>Syria, Ethion</hi> of <hi>Boetia,</hi> (ſure it ſhould be <hi>Beotia) Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> of <hi>Creet,</hi> &amp;c. whereas indeed there were no ſuch names or men, and moſt of theſe Countreys named by him in the laſt place,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:102628:216"/> were but Provinces then under the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Empire, and no Kings nor Dukes, but only Preſidents ruling them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Emperour. Wherefore, if he could ſo boldly invent ſuch a liſt of Kings abroad in the World, for the ſixth Age of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, wherein he could be ſo eaſily diſproved by a thouſand arguments: we have no reaſon to think that for home and thoſe early Ages of the World, wherein he could not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by any Records, he did otherwiſe than meerly forge his Catalogue of <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Kings. And theſe are the Reaſons that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me to this Reflection upon that ſtory of <hi>Coilus</hi> and <hi>Fergus</hi> in <hi>Buchanan,</hi> as related out of him in my foreſaid 19th <hi>page.</hi> And the ſame reaſons, or at leaſt a ſufficient part of them, makes me likewiſe not inſiſt now upon the name of <hi>Notium,</hi> which you have ſeen before (<hi>page</hi> 13.) given to <hi>Breoghuin</hi>'s Tower in <hi>Gallicia.</hi> It was (I doubt not) borrowed by <hi>Keting</hi> from <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> who ſays in expreſs terms, that place was called firſt <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantia,</hi> but after <hi>Notium,</hi> and laſt of all <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtella.</hi> I know there is a Promontory in <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>54.

He ſays, that this very <hi>Fergus</hi> (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by him to have been the over-thrower of <hi>Coilus,</hi> and by <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> to have alſo been the ſon of <hi>Ferchardus</hi> King of <hi>Ireland</hi>) was the Founder of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Kingdom in <hi>Albania,</hi> and firſt of all the Kings of the <hi>Scots</hi> inhabiting <hi>Great Brittain.</hi> That he came to <hi>Albania</hi> (or <hi>Scotland</hi>) about the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi>'s taking <hi>Babylon,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 331. years before the Birth of Chriſt. And that within twenty four years more, having reign'd in all ſo long, in his return from <hi>Ireland</hi> (whither he had gone back from <hi>Scotland</hi> to quiet ſome diſturbances there) he periſh'd at Sea in a Tempeſt, near that Rock in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which, from his wrack hard by, is ever ſince call'd in Latin <hi>Rupes Ferguſii,</hi> (in Iriſh <hi>Carrig-Fhearuis,</hi> by us <hi>Knock-Fergus.</hi>) So ſays <hi>Buchanan:</hi> and ſo ſaid before him <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> and ſome others of his Countreymen Hiſtorians: both he and they either ſeeming to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of thoſe <hi>Annals</hi> and Books whence only the real true Hiſtory of their Antiquities could be known: or elſe wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to have taken up a fabulous ſtory, of

Where, to ground this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his, he produces an old <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Ninnius;</hi> I mean as to the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kings in that ancient Author: and fixes in particular on eighteen of them by name, among which is one <hi>Gregory,</hi> albeit <hi>Gregory</hi> be the Lxxiii. King of <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>'s Catalogue, and that King too in whom <hi>Buchanan</hi> glories ſo much as to record him to poſterity by the Title of <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> which he ſays was deſervedly given him by his own People. 5. That although, in <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi>'s account, this very <hi>Gregory</hi> began his Regn <hi>an. Chriſti</hi> 870. and finiſh'd it by his
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:102628:220"/> death <hi>anno</hi> 892. and conſequently was not only King of <hi>Scots,</hi> but of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being the <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kingdom there (at leaſt as 'tis commonly ſuppos'd) had been utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, full thirty years before the very firſt of his Reign: yet if his being either King of <hi>Scotland</hi> or King of <hi>Scots</hi> be no truer than <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s Relation of his invading <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> fighting a great Battel victoriouſly there againſt the two Protectors or Tutors of the young King <hi>Duncanus</hi> a Minor, and then viſiting this young King at <hi>Dublin</hi> where he reſided, and then appointing new Tutors for him, and laſt of all taking with him to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> threeſcore <hi>Iriſh</hi> Hoſtages out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces of <hi>Ireland:</hi> I dare ſay there was never any ſuch thing, or Perſon or Prince as <hi>Gregory</hi> King of <hi>Scots.</hi> For beſides what I have given before (<hi>page</hi> 23 &amp; 24.) to diſprove this great fiction of <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> either conquering or at all invading <hi>Ireland:</hi> 'tis clear out of all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Antiquities recording the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Wars, that not the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> nor any <hi>Iriſh</hi> King, Minor or not Minor, did poſſeſs <hi>Dublin</hi> at that time, but the <hi>Danes.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to confirm this truth, the Annals of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> tell us, that in the year of our Lord 871. two great <hi>Daniſh</hi> Captains, <hi>viz. Ainlaph and Juor came from</hi> Albania <hi>to</hi> Ath-Cliath (alias <hi>Dublin) with two hundred ſail, and an
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:102628:221"/> exceeding great Prey of</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and</hi> Brittons, <hi>and</hi> Picts. <hi>whom they brought Captives to</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. So that <hi>Dublin</hi> moſt certainly was, in the Reign of that <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not under any Monarch or other <hi>Iriſh</hi> King, as no more was it in a hundred and fifty years fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, but in the power of the <hi>Danes,</hi> who were at leaſt the firſt Re-builders of it much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame time that <hi>Buchanan</hi> ſuppoſes it to have been the Metropolitan City of <hi>Ireland;</hi> tho it came not to be ſo till <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's Reign. For he indeed was the firſt King or Lord of <hi>Ireland</hi> that ever kept his Court there, and by appointing it the Reſidence of his Vice-Roys gave it in a little time ſo great ſplendor, that the Forger ſeeing it ſo in his own time, thought fit in much earlier times to place his forged <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarch (of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Scotlands</hi> ſtory) <hi>Duncanus</hi> in it as in the Royal Manſion of the Kings of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Whereas to the contrary, nothing is more known in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Hiſtories, than that the City of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi> full twenty miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> was the Royal Seat of the Kings of <hi>Ireland,</hi> till its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by the firſt <hi>Daniſh</hi> War, and in the ſame days <hi>Dublin</hi> at beſt but a very mean place reſpectively. 6. That nevertheleſs, as I am apt enough to believe, that, allowing <hi>Cambden</hi> the liberty of an hyperbolical expreſſion, he has upon ſufficient grounds told us, that <hi>the Earls of</hi> Argile <hi>derive their Race from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:102628:221"/> Princes and Potentates of</hi> Argile, <hi>by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite deſcent of Anceſtors:</hi> ſo I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that by how much the Genealogy of Kings muſt be more narrowly ſifted than that of any Subjects, by ſo much <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> has upon ſurer grounds exactly derived in a direct Line the deſcent of <hi>James</hi> the ſixth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and firſt of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> not only through ſo many Kings his Predeceſſors of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the ancient Kings of <hi>Argile,</hi> up along to <hi>Fergus</hi> I. nor only from thoſe before that very <hi>Fergus,</hi> through fourteen Generations up to <hi>Reuda:</hi> but even before this <hi>Reuda,</hi> through fifty three Generations, whereof Twenty four were Monarchs of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> up along to <hi>Herimon,</hi> the firſt ſole ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarch of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> blood in that Kingdom, even ſo long ſince as Three thouſand years, wanting only ſeven. Nay, I am likewiſe perſuaded, that he has alſo very exactly in two other Lines, carried up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the ſame King <hi>James,</hi> through thirty one other Monarchs of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Herimon:</hi> as alſo in a fourth and fifth Line through four and twenty more of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchs (and here I mean twenty four more wholly different from all thoſe fifty ſix already given of <hi>Herimons</hi> Race.) up along to <hi>Heber;</hi> who being the ſtock in theſe two laſt Lines, makes the 25th King of <hi>Ireland</hi> in this number aſcending upwards: for ſo he
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:102628:222"/> was (during his ſhort life) in a joynt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, with his foreſaid Brother <hi>Herimon.</hi> 7. That undoubtedly this derivation of King <hi>James</hi> through ſo many Lines for three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, and from the Loins of eighty one <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchs, beſides all the truly real both Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Kings of <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>Dal-Riada</hi> and <hi>Argathelia</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> given us at large by <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> (in his <hi>Camb.

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:102628:224"/> ſtone as with Turfs (as having no cunning Artificer for ſo great a piece of Work) and the ſame to no uſe, between two Friths or arms of the Sea, for many miles in length: that where the fence of Water was wanting, there by the help of a Wall they might defend their borders from the invaſion of Enemies. Of which work, that is to ſay, a very broad and high Wall, a man may ſee to this day moſt certain and and evident remains.

                     <hi>Paulus Oroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſays this Wall was carried croſs the Land for one hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles.

And in the xii. Chapter of that ſame firſt Book, he tells us at large of two other Walls,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:102628:225"/> even long after that time of <hi>Severus,</hi> built from Sea to Sea. The one, which is that here deſcribed by <hi>Cambden,</hi> built of Soads and Stakes by the <hi>Brittons</hi> themſelves, when the firſt ſupply of <hi>Romans,</hi> come to beat back thoſe Northern Foes, having done ſo, were upon their return home. The other, ſome time after, of ſtone, eight foot broad and twelve foot high, built at both the publick and private charge, by the joint concurrence of the <hi>Brittons</hi> and laſt <hi>Roman</hi> Legion come to defend them. Beſides in the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he tells us of the Towers built on the South of the Weſtern Sea (or that of <hi>Dun-Britton</hi>) at convenient diſtances, to defend the <hi>Brittons</hi> from the plundering Fleets of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> But for any Wall or Fence either of ſtone or Earth made under <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Younger, <hi>Bede</hi> has not a word; but rather plainly ſhews the contrary Chap. 13, where he tells in plain terms, that <hi>Aelius</hi> to whom the <hi>Britons</hi> made their application for new ſupplies again, refuſed to ſend them any: and that as for that later Wall and thoſe Caſtles of ſtone, how ſtrongly ſoever built, they were ſoon ſcaled, and forc'd by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> and the miſerable <hi>Britons</hi> quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run by both a new, even from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of theſe very Fortifications of Lime and Stone.</p>

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:102628:228"/> fought, as he ſays, in the reign of <hi>Cairbre Lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for,</hi> Monarch of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the ſeven Kings of that Nation and their Army 65000 Horſe and Foot, againſt the <hi>Daniſh Bownies</hi> (who had been formerly entertain'd by thoſe Princes to defend their Coaſts, but now rebell'd) being 28700, hardy reſolute Warriours: and fought well-nigh a whole day with equal Fortune ſo mortally, that Horſes were up to their bellies in blood: until at laſt Fortune favouring the righteous Cauſe of the Princes, they put theſe rebellious forein Bownies to a total rout, and edg of the Sword all of them, although it coſt their ſide alſo very dear, even the lives of four of their Kings, and nineteen thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty others.</p>
               <p>All theſe Relations, though given as true ones by <hi>Hanmer</hi> at large, I have paſs'd by. Firſt, becauſe of their manifeſt repugnancy to all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chronicles.

That under <hi>Pharaoh Cingeris</hi> he was born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> though begotten by <hi>Niall</hi> Brother to the King of <hi>Scythia.</hi> That his Father <hi>Niull</hi> was both
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:102628:229"/> contemporary and acquainted with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and offered to do him ſervice &amp; kindneſs too when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were upon the banks of the <hi>Red</hi> Sea to croſs it over: <hi>Niull</hi> being then by <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s gift poſſeſſor and Lord of a large Countrey near that place where the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> encamp'd at that time. That as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Niull,</hi> ſo the Son <hi>Gaodheal</hi> (or <hi>Gathelus</hi>) and children after him, continued in <hi>Egypt</hi> until <hi>Pharaoh Intius</hi> baniſh'd the whole Race of them away, and forc'd them to ſeek their Adventures elſewhere under the conduct of <hi>Sruth</hi> the ſon of <hi>Eaſruth,</hi> ſon to the ſaid <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelus,</hi> or <hi>Gaodheal Glas.</hi> That <hi>Mileadh</hi> (or <hi>Mileſius</hi>) whoſe poſterity long after invaded, conquered and poſſeſs'd <hi>Ireland,</hi> was the nineteenh Generation from the ſaid <hi>Gathelus:</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh Nectanibus,</hi> being the XVth <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> after <hi>Cingeris</hi> who had been drown'd in the <hi>Red</hi> Sea, was the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who gave his Daughter to <hi>Mileſius</hi> in marriage. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be from the ſaid <hi>Gaodheal Glas,</hi> the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Race in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Race alſo of their Coſins that came with them out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and thoſe and theſe only of all the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> be properly called <hi>Gaoidhil</hi> or <hi>Clanna Gaoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heal,</hi> i. e. the children or deſcendants of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelus;</hi> yet tſte <hi>Iriſh</hi> Language is not from him called <hi>Gaodhealc;</hi> but from an other <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelus</hi> or <hi>Gaodheal</hi> former to him: another I mean, who either compos'd, or at leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:102628:229"/> and diſtinguiſh'd it into thoſe five ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral different idioms, or dialects for Poetry, Law, Genealogy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all of them by any one man, that they would require the whole Age of a man to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto them. Laſtly, that the poſterity of the later <hi>Gaodheal,</hi> I mean <hi>Gaodheal Glas,</hi> and of his Wife <hi>Scota,</hi> (at leaſt ſo called) <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Race &amp; their Coſins, had been poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of <hi>Ireland</hi> near 1320 years before the birth Chriſt. In which account, or period of time, even <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> himſelf and <hi>Polichronicon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as we have ſeen before <hi>page</hi> 6. And therefore that ſtory of <hi>Hanmer,</hi> derived from <hi>Harding</hi> and <hi>Meuin,</hi> telling us of <hi>Gathelus</hi> and <hi>Scotas</hi> coming to theſe Northern parts, or landing in <hi>Ireland</hi> anno Chriſti 75. muſt be one of the moſt ridiculous ſtories in the world. They were dead well nigh two thouſand years before: and in their life-time never left <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> for ought that may be known of them.</p>
               <p>In the next place they tell us, that <hi>Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi> whom they call <hi>Partholan,</hi> enter'd, planted, and poſſeſs'd <hi>Ireland, anno Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi> 1956. that is, about 300 years after the Flood. Argument enough, that <hi>Hanmer</hi> knew nothing of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Hiſtory, when he joyn'd together <hi>Bartolanus</hi> and the <hi>Mileſian</hi> off ſpring, as being of a company, and entring <hi>Ireland</hi> at the ſame time: for this alſo he does. And yet we have ſeen before, that the <hi>Mileſians</hi>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:102628:230"/> came not to <hi>Ireland</hi> before the year of the World 2736. that is 731 years after <hi>Bartola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> had ſetled there.</p>
               <p>50. Beſides, they tell us particularly and unanimouſly that as we have often ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in that year of the World 2736. and before Chriſt 1308 years, thoſe <hi>Iherians</hi> the ſons of <hi>Mileſius</hi> landed and conquer'd <hi>Ireland.</hi> How then could they be conducted thither, and aſſign'd that Countrey for their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Gurguntius</hi> King of <hi>Great Brittain.</hi> He was not in being then, nor in many Ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I am ſure he was not King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> by <hi>Hanmer</hi>'s own relation, until the year of the World 3580. Nor was he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor of thoſe <hi>Iberians</hi> to <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor did they ſwear allegiance to him until the year of the World 3592, and before the birth of Chriſt 376, according to <hi>Campions</hi> account. That is full 858 years after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd that Kingdom. And therefore I need not quarrel either <hi>Campion</hi> or <hi>Hanmer,</hi> about their relating thoſe <hi>Iberians</hi> or <hi>Spaniards,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their paſſing to <hi>Ireland</hi> to have dwell'd in <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> or towards <hi>Baiona,</hi> or within the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of that ſo great and Capital a City then, though it be not true. Nor need I expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with them about their affirming that <hi>Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntius</hi> had the Sovereign Rule of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and City, and conſequently of theſe very
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:102628:230"/> 
                  <hi>Mileſians</hi> when they dwelt thereabouts, before their adventuring to <hi>Ireland.</hi> Enough is ſaid already to ruin this whole ſtory: And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, enough to overthrow all the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of that pretended ſubjection of <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Gurguntius.</hi> But if I mind you once more that <hi>Polichronicon,</hi> nay <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> himſelf (who is the Ringleader as in many other, ſo particularly in this matter to <hi>Campion, Hanmer,</hi> and other late Authors) confeſſes the landing of thoſe <hi>Iberians</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> full 1800 years before the miſſion of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> to <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Celeſtinus</hi> in the year of Chriſt 431. then I doubt whether I have not ſaid more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough on the Subject. I am ſure that by this very computation or confeſſion of <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> and their own account of the year before Chriſt, wherein <hi>Hanmer</hi> and <hi>Campion</hi> ſay, <hi>Gurguntius</hi> met thoſe <hi>Iberians</hi> at Sea: this year before Chriſt, and this meeting of <hi>Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntius</hi> at Sea muſt be later by a whole thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years of the World, than that aſſign'd by <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> for the conqueſt made on <hi>Ireland</hi> by the ſame <hi>Iberians,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Antiquaries no leſs particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly tell us, that <hi>Crioſſan Niad Nar</hi> was Monarch of <hi>Ireland</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Keting.</note> when our Saviour was born, That this divine Generation happened in the 12th year of his Reign, and his Reign laſted
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:102628:231"/> in all but four years more. That <hi>Conchabhar Abhraruadh</hi> was King before him for one year only: but before him, <hi>Lughadh Sriabhndearg</hi> had continued Monarch ſix and twenty years compleat. That this ſame <hi>Lughadh</hi> married the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Daughter: and before his Reign immediately an <hi>Interregnum</hi> of five years had been, which followed upon the murder of <hi>Conair Mor mhic Eidirſceoil:</hi> and before this <hi>Interregnum,</hi> the ſame <hi>Conair Mor</hi> had reigned full ſeventy years in great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. That, after the foreſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

That theſe &amp; thoſe, in all ſeven Monarchs, were every one of them kill'd in ſuch and ſuch manner, and by ſuch and ſuch men of their own very Nation. That after the ſeventh of them had been ſlaughtered by the <hi>Athaghtuachi,</hi> or Countrey Boors and <hi>Plebeians,</hi> in their General con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt all the Royal and noble Blood; the ſame <hi>Athatchtuachi</hi> ſet up for King of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> one <hi>Cairbre,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Ceannchait,</hi> or <hi>Cait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheann</hi> from his <hi>Cats</hi> face, an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man indeed by birth, but by deſcent originally, that is in the Ninth generation before, come out of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as one of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s ſons, who had

And all theſe matters, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſo many other particular appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants on them, within the Reigns of thoſe eight or nine Monarchs: which Reigns com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd the whole Reign and Life too, nay much more time before and after than the whole Reign, or Life either, of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Antiquaries give us moſt exactly at large. And yet not a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of <hi>Fredelenus,</hi> nor of either of the <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi>'s; no nor indeed of any other forein King, or Prince, or Adventurer, ſo much as invading <hi>Ireland,</hi> within or near that time, though they wanted not occaſion in <hi>Lughad</hi>'s Reign, and in <hi>Caibre Ceannchaits</hi> (as we have ſeen) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on ſuch matters, if any ſuch had really been.</p>

Alſo it may be added, That as <hi>Keting</hi> ſays, <hi>Ferguſius</hi> the Firſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> was Brother to the foreſaid <hi>Muirchiortach</hi> King of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And conſequently, that the Subjects of <hi>Muirchiortach</hi> were great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors in the Northern parts of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> at that very time. Yea that, as <hi>Buchanan</hi> himſelf, in the Reign of <hi>Goranus</hi> (the XLV. King of <hi>Scotland</hi> in his Computation and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory) relates it, The great Battel of <hi>Humber,</hi> wherein <hi>Arthur</hi> was not only defeated but mortally wounded; nay in effect loſt both Kingdom and life, was fought againſt him
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:102628:233"/> by an Army of <hi>Iriſh Scots,</hi> however in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy and conjunction with the <hi>Picts</hi> and ſome <hi>Brittons</hi> led in the ſame Field by <hi>Modroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> againſt him.</p>
               <p>Out of all which may be ſeen how unlikely the ſtories of King <hi>Arthur</hi> in <hi>Polychronicon, Hanmer, Campion,</hi> &amp;c. which relate to <hi>Ireland,</hi> are. How improbable that muſt be of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaſterienſis,</hi> in his years of Chriſt 497. and 592. which attributing the Monarchical power of <hi>Ireland</hi> to one <hi>Gillamurius</hi> (alias <hi>Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>) one that was never heard of in <hi>Ireland,</hi> repreſents him notwithſtanding as taken there by King <hi>Arthur:</hi> and thereupon the reſt of the <hi>Iriſh Princes</hi> e'en plainly forc'd to yield themſelves all and do homage to <hi>Arthur.</hi> How vain alſo is that of <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> to the ſame purpoſe written before, telling us, <hi>It is read, that the famous King of the</hi> Brittons Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur <hi>had the Kings of</hi> Ireland <hi>his Tributaries, and that ſome of them waited on him in his great Court of</hi> Caer Leon. But above all the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and ingenuity of honeſt <hi>Galfridus,</hi> the firſt forger of theſe among ſo many other Fables, appears in grain; however <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> had not the confidence either to quote him for it, or to mention at all <hi>Gillamurius,</hi> though a part of it.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding any thing hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to either in this place, or elſewhere ſaid, I
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:102628:233"/> doubt not the poſterity of the ancient <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> have juſt reaſon if not to glory of King <hi>Arthurs</hi> Trophies, at leaſt to be ſorry for his untimely Death, and heartily wiſh, their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours had not deſerv'd to ſee their bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes in him, ſo ſuddenly vaniſh. Though at the ſame time, I muſt ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, there are but too too many reaſons able to ſuſpend any judicious knowing man's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of what even <hi>Buchanan</hi> himſelf has in our own days tranſmitted to Poſterity, for authentick Truths of this famous Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, glorious performances, <hi>viz.</hi> That he had continually been for many years, but moſt particularly and gloriouſly in twelve great Battels, victorious over the <hi>Saxons.</hi> That he took at laſt even <hi>York</hi> and <hi>London</hi> from them: and, after this again overthrew them in very <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> where they were ſtrongeſt and placed their laſt reſerve. That he forc'd the remainders of them either to fly the Kingdom, or ſubmit to his pleaſure. In a word, That he reſtored his whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and perfect peace unto it. And that this happy effect of his pious and victorious Armes continued until the ambition, anger, and, which you pleaſe to call it, either trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous rebellion, or juſt indignation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of his Nephew <hi>Modroedus</hi> for being put by the right of Succeſſion, gave too great
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:102628:234"/> a turn to his fortunate ſucceſſes; chiefly by the <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> i. e. <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army's falling from him, and their conjunction with <hi>Modroedus</hi> againſt him. For this alſo I muſt here particularly note, that during their confederacy and ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, which had early begun and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continued from the very beginning of his Wars until this unlucky difference about the ſucceſſion, and ſecond unlucky Battel of <hi>Humber</hi> that followed thereupon, he alſo continued perpetually ſucceſsful. But ſo ſoon as they joyn'd againſt him, fortune deſerted him, and, together with him, his Countrey. But whether ſo, or no? or whether indeed any of thoſe other particulars related of K. <hi>Arthur</hi> by <hi>Buchanan</hi> himſelf as true Hiſtory, be or be not ſuch as he would have us believe: I think enough return'd in anſwer to <hi>Hanmer</hi> and <hi>Campion</hi>'s making the Kings of <hi>Ireland</hi> Tributary to King <hi>Arthur</hi> of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, becauſe I believe it not very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein nor much beſide the matter, I do on this occaſion add, That <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> found ſo little ſatisfaction to his mind, nay ſo great certainty of untruth in the relations written of this ſo much celebrated King <hi>Arthur,</hi> that although in his Hiſtory (<hi>l.</hi> 3) he ſums up in brief (that is in ſeven or eight lines) all the Wonders of them: yet as he calls them, ſo
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:102628:234"/> he reputes them, no other than <hi>Vulgar ſtories</hi> Which to have been his inward ſentiment of thoſe relations, may be further ſeen by his telling us, That although King <hi>Arthur</hi> died in the very flower of his youth; yet becauſe of his exceeding great ſtrength of body, and no leſs vigorous heroick bravery of Soul, Poſterity has reported almoſt the very ſame Wonders of him, which in our own time are among the <hi>Italians</hi> Romantickly ſung of <hi>Rowland</hi> Nephew to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi> And this, without ſo much as mentioning any years at all of his Reign, is all that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidore</hi> has of this great <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Heroe. Save only that he was the ſon of King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter-pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragon.</hi> That if he had lived a while (<hi>i. e.</hi> his juſt age) longer, he had at laſt reſtored his periſhing Countrey. And, that but a few years before the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. there was in <hi>Glaſtenbury</hi> Cloyſter a very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Tomb, erected to his memory: of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that after Ages might be thereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, he had been a Prince adorned with all whatever ought be reputed moſt excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great and ſtupendious: and that this Tomb, as if it had been erected ſoon after his death, had certainly been deſign'd a memorial of his glory; whereas indeed the Cloiſter it ſelf, wherein it ſtood, was not in being then. So this Author <hi>Polydore Virgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:102628:235"/>
               <p>And yet after all, I cannot but acknowledg. that ſo great a concurrence of other Authors, together with the general vogue of King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi> even all along to our time in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that all ſides are agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his having exiſted or been, and been alſo about the year of Chriſt five hundred King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> muſt argue of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſome great extraordinary exploits of his againſt the <hi>Saxons.</hi> Nor truly do I ſee, how otherwiſe <hi>Polydore</hi> himſelf cou'd ſay, That if he had lived longer a while, he had enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiz'd his Countrey. Neither is it a valuable argument to the contrary, at leaſt if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the judicious impartial <hi>Cambden,</hi> That the <hi>Saxon Chronologie</hi> or other <hi>Saxon</hi> Authors have nothing of him and his brave atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt them. I am ſure I have my ſelf read in <hi>Cambden</hi> this very day to this purpoſe, That he has obſerv'd, the <hi>Saxon</hi> Writers defective in this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> That they paſs over in ſilence what was bravely done againſt their own Nation, and only care the recording what redounded to their glory, or concern'd their own People. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all is, That the Romantick ſtories made of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> by idle Wits in part, and part by others, who as they were equally ambitious to magnifie their Nation, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:102628:235"/> or heedleſs, how eaſily they might be diſprov'd out of the known undoubted Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the times, brought his true deeds into queſtion ſo far, that no man knows which, or what to believe of them.</p>
               <p>51. To ruin the Romantick Fable indeed of <hi>Hanmer</hi>'s three incredible Armies <note n="*" place="margin">In my 26 <hi>page</hi> my memory fail'd me, when relying upon it, as having not had the Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> as <hi>Hanmer</hi> ſays he was, but Monarch of <hi>Ireland.</hi> That he came to the Monarchy in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:102628:236"/> the year of the World 5324. of Chriſt 122, and continued Monarch thirty five years, till he was murthered by Aſſaſſines, employ'd on that Errand by <hi>Tibraid Tiriogh</hi> King of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi> which happened at leaſt a hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome.</hi> That as he was called or ſurnamed in Iriſh <hi>Ceadchatach,</hi> in Latin <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timachus,</hi> from the hundred Battels which he had fought: ſo he fought not any of them, or other ſoever againſt any Foreiner, but all againſt his own Countrey-men the native <hi>Iriſh:</hi> nor in all his Reign, as neither indeed for ſome Ages before and after it, did any Foreigners invade the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> That although <hi>Cairbre Liſſechaire</hi> was Monarch of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; begun his Reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 5456, <hi>Chriſti</hi> 267. and continued it twenty ſeven years; and ſo perhaps might have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, for ſome part of his Reign, with <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet during his Reign there was no other Battel fought in <hi>Ireland</hi> but the Battel of <hi>Gowra.</hi> I am ſure none at all mention'd by <hi>Keting;</hi> who yet makes it the chief buſineſs of his Hiſtory to mention the Battels fought in the Reign of every Monarch. That the Battel of <hi>Gowra</hi> was occaſion'd by a difference happening and continuing ſome years betwixt the family or Sept of <hi>Baoiskin,</hi> whereof <hi>Fionn mhac Cuuail</hi> was
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:102628:236"/> one, and the Sept of <hi>Morna,</hi> meer <hi>Iriſh</hi> of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Conqueſt both; and both contending for the command of the ſtanding <hi>Militia</hi> of the Countrey: and <hi>Caibre Lioffechair</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch favouring one ſide, and others of great power the other; the contention at laſt came to a Battel, called from the place where it was fought the Battel of <hi>Gowra,</hi> where this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch was kill'd by one <hi>Kirbe.</hi> Which is all the account <hi>Keting</hi> has of it; but without mention of any other Fight, in this Monarchs Reign. Though by his telling us the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and the Parties that fought, you ſee they were no <hi>Danes,</hi> nor <hi>Daniſh</hi> Bowny's, but meer <hi>Iriſh</hi> Bowny's: and theſe neither of one ſide; but ſome of one and ſome of the other, the quarrel requiring it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the particulars (and many more I might add) which together with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon before them given moved me to paſs by ſo many ill-contrived ſtories as I have mention'd here, beſides many other out of <hi>Hanmer.</hi> But for his relation of the Battel of <hi>Clantarff:</hi> being it is not only almoſt in every particular ſo contrary to all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chronicles, but indeed as to the <hi>White Daniſh Knight,</hi> and <hi>his injur'd Bed,</hi> and <hi>Sword and Scabbard,</hi> and <hi>thirty thouſand Danes</hi> landed with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a meer Romantick ſtory: there needs no more be ſaid of it. Nor am I mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:102628:237"/> at all by <hi>Hanmers</hi> quoting the Book of <hi>Houth</hi> for himſelf both in this Relation and ſeveral other. 1. Becauſe (for many reaſons needleſs to be given here) I take not the Book of <hi>Houth,</hi> as neither indeed any <hi>Engliſh</hi> or other Foreign Author, to be of any credit in ſuch matters of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Antiquity as preceded the <hi>Engliſh Conqueſt</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> if otherwiſe in themſelves either improbable, or contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole current of the genuine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of that Nation, extant ſtill, and written in their own Language. That is to ſay, in a Language, which neither the Authors of the Book of <hi>Houth,</hi> nor other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor any Foreiner whatſoever could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand without the help of a very skilful perfect Scholar in it, even ſuch a one, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ten thouſand <hi>Iriſh</hi> Natives cannot be found at preſent, nor could for many Ages paſt. 2. Becauſe, having never ſeen that Book of <hi>Houth,</hi> I cannot rely on <hi>Hanmers</hi> quotation of it; as whom I have manifeſtly found in ſeveral places to make too bold with ſeveral other Authors. For having theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors at hand, peruſed and compared them with his quotations of them, I have reaſon to perſuade my ſelf, that either he never read 'em, or (which muſt be worſe) wilfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon them againſt his own knowledg.</p>

               <p>53.

For the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that conquer'd both' were not ſo numerous then as to plant the one half, nay nor a third part of all thoſe Countreys now comprehended under the name of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> though they became Lords of all by that Battel wherein they deſtroy'd utterly the <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kingdom. So that you may conclude, the preſent <hi>Engliſh Scots</hi> (as they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd, but not thoſe other who go by the name of <hi>Scoti Albini</hi>

What may be of more advantage for underſtanding ſomewhat better thoſe affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi> is, I doubt not, this following paſſage out of <hi>Cambden,</hi> 
                  <q>After that the <hi>Scots</hi> were come into <hi>Brittain,</hi> and had joyn'd themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Picts,</hi> albeit they never ceas'd to vex the <hi>Brittons</hi> with skirmiſhes and inroads, yet grew they not preſently into any great State, but kept a long time in that corner where they firſt arrived, not daring, as <hi>Beda</hi> writes, for the ſpace of 127 years to come forth into the Field againſt the Princes of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> Until at one and the ſame time they had made ſuch a ſlaughter of the <hi>Picts,</hi> that few or none of them were left alive: and withal the Kingdom of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> what with civil Diſſentions, what with Invaſions of the <hi>Danes,</hi> ſore ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and weakned, fell at once to the ground.

The Relation of <hi>Cambrenſis (To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pograp. Hib. d. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c.</hi> 9.) may be rendred thus in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> 
                  <q>There is in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> a Lake of vaſt extenſion, thirty miles long, and fifteen broad; unto which, as they ſay, a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:102628:239"/> chance gave beginning. In that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which is now the Lake, there was in very ancient times a moſt vitious Nation, but chiefly and incorrigibly above all other People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> given over to that ſin we call Beſtiality. And there was amongſt them a Prophetical ſaying, That ſo ſoon as a certain <hi>Well</hi> of that Countrey were at any time left uncovered (for out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to it, proceeding from barbarous ſuperſtition, it had both a covering and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature, or lock) it ſhould preſently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow ſo prodigiouſly as to drown the whole Countrey thereabouts. Which accordingly happen'd on this occaſion. One of the Countrey Women having open'd it to bring Water home, it chanc'd that before ſhe had throughly done, ſhe heard her Child a little diſtance off crying: and going in haſte to ſtill him, ſhe forgot to cover the Well. Whereupon it overflow'd on a ſudden ſo ſtrangely, that not only the Woman her ſelf and her Child with her, but all the People univerſally and all the very Cattel too of the whole Countrey for very many miles, were, as by a particular and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Deluge, covered, overwhelmed, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed utterly in the Waters. As if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature had judg'd that Land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Inhabitants, which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of ſuch enormous turpitude againſt
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:102628:240"/> Nature. And indeed that ſuch had been the original of this Lake, it is no improbable argument, that the Fiſhermen upon it do manifeſtly in fair ſerene weather ſee, under them in the Water, Church Turrets, which according to the faſhion of thoſe in that Land are not only narrow and high, but round withal; and that they often ſhew them to paſſengers waſted over this Lake, who are ſtrangely aſtoniſhed at the ſight and cauſe. You are alſo to note, That the River which abundantly flows out of the ſame Lake, being one of the nine Principal Rivers of <hi>Ireland,</hi> namely the <hi>Ban,</hi> did even from the beginning (that is, ever ſince the time of <hi>Bartholanus</hi>) though in a much ſmaller ſtream, flow from the foreſaid <hi>Well</hi> all along that Countrey, other Waters fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into it ſtill as it went farther off. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto <hi>Gerald</hi> of <hi>Wales.</hi> But to this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, it will not be amiſs to add what <hi>Cambden</hi> ſays applying it, and interpreting and making this nameleſs Pool to be the famous <hi>Loch Erne</hi> of ſo many miles in length and breadth, and the People deſtroy'd to have been ſome <hi>Hebridians</hi> got thither.</q>

In the midſt whereof is that famous and greateſt Meere of all Ireland, <hi>Loch Erne,</hi> ſtretching out forty miles, bordered about with ſhady Woods, and paſſing full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited Iſlands, whereof ſome contain a hundred, two hundred, three hundred acres of ground: having beſides ſuch ſtore of Pikes, Truots, and Salmons, that the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men complain oftner of too great plenty of Fiſhes, and of the breaking of their Nets, than they do for want of draught. This Lake ſpreadeth not from Eaſt to Weſt (as it is deſcrib'd in the common Maps) but, as I have heard thoſe ſay who have taken a long and good ſurvey thereof, firſt at <hi>Bel Tarbet,</hi> which is a little Town fartheſt North of any in this County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> it ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from South to North fourteen miles in length, and four in breadth.

Though Almighty God (ſays <hi>Giraldus)</hi> Creator of Nature, judg'd this Land, privy to ſo filthy Acts againſt Nature, unworthy to hold not only the firſt Inhabitants, but any other for the time to come. Howbeit this wickedneſs the <hi>Iriſh Annals</hi> lay upon certain Iſlanders out of the <hi>Hebrides,</hi> who being fled out of their own Countrey, lurked there. So he.</q>

               <p>Againſt theſe Relations, the one of <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis,</hi> and the other of <hi>Cambden;</hi> though the later, as to the original of this Lake, is wholly grounded on the former, <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> oppoſes many Reaſons. 1. That all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Annals and Hiſtories, who treat of <hi>Loch Ern,</hi> attribute the original of it, not to the overflowing of any Well or River, but to a meer eruption of Waters out of the very entrails of the Earth, without any kind of mention of Beſtiality or other ſin of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants which might at all any way deſerve it. 2. That this Eruption happened in the Reign
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:102628:241"/> of <hi>Fiacha Lauranne</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">But <hi>Keting</hi> ſays it happen'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reign of <hi>Tighermhais</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias <hi>Tighterm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huir</hi>) forty ſix years before <hi>Fiacha La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bhraina</hi> came to be King.</note> King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> immediately after the great Victory got by Him over the remainders of the Nation call'd <hi>Fir-bholg,</hi> who till then had kept and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited that Tract of ground where this Lake did ſo burſt forth on a ſudden: and conſequently, That it happen'd before the year of the World 3751. becauſe, according to to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chronology, <hi>Fiacha Laurainne</hi> came to the Crown of <hi>Ireland</hi> by killing his Predeceſſor <hi>Eochuidh Fuibherghlas,</hi> in the year of the World 3727. and held it twenty years more, or rather to the year of the World 3751. when himſelf was likewiſe kill'd by <hi>Eochuidh Mumho</hi> that ſucceeded him in the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 3. That ſuch, and ſo early to have been the original of this Lake, without either <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiality,</hi> or <hi>Well,</hi> or other enormous or mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous cauſe mention'd by any <hi>Iriſh</hi> Records or Books, <hi>Amhirgin</hi> the ſon of <hi>Amhalgadh mhic Mholruana</hi> had delivered in the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Book which he not only compos'd of all the chief places, Countreys, Tracts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but rehears'd before <hi>Diarmuid O Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arbheoil</hi> the Monarch, and other Princes and Peers of the Nation aſſembled together at <hi>Tarach,</hi> about the year of Chriſt 500: adding
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:102628:242"/> withal in the ſame Book, that ſome former Hiſtorians were of opinion, This Lake had a long time, yea many Ages after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, taken its denomination of <hi>Erne</hi> a Maid ſervant to the famous <hi>Meabh Chruachain,</hi> Queen of <hi>Connaght,</hi> drown'd therein. Which <hi>Meabh Chruachain</hi> was Daughter to <hi>Eochuidh Feilioch</hi> the Monarch, Author of the <hi>Pentarchy,</hi> who ended both his Reign and life in the year of the World 5069. that is, according to the account follow'd by <hi>Lucius,</hi> a hundred and thirty one years before the Incarnation of our Lord. 4. That hence appears not only the falſity of the Relation it ſelf, but the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Relatour <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> (in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Ireland)</hi> where he ſays, That <hi>Church-Towers</hi> were ſeen in that Lake he deſcribes to have had ſo prodigious an original: inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating hereby, as if <hi>Loch Ern</hi> had its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after the plantation of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in that Kingdom. Whereas we have now ſeen it was broke out even 1427. before the very birth of Chriſt, which was in the year of the World 5199. Beſides, it is moſt certain, that thoſe <hi>high, round, narrow</hi> Towers of ſtone, built cylinder-wiſe, whereof <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> ſpeaks, were never known or built in <hi>Ireland</hi> (as indeed no more were any Caſtles, Houſes, or even Churches of ſtone, at leaſt in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland)</hi> before the year of Chriſt 838.
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:102628:242"/> when the Heathen <hi>Danes</hi> poſſeſſing a great part of that Countrey, built them in ſeveral places, to ſerve themſelves as Watch-Towers againſt the Natives. Though ere long, the <hi>Danes</hi> being expuls'd, the <hi>Chriſtian Iriſh</hi> turn'd. them to another and much better (becauſe a holy) uſe, that is to Steeple-Houſes or Bell-Fries, to hang Bells in for calling the People to Church. From which later uſe made of them, it is, that ever ſince to this preſent, they are call'd in Iriſh <hi>Cloctheachs,</hi> that is Bell-Fries, or Bell-Houſes; <hi>Cloc</hi> or <hi>Clog,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying a Bell, and <hi>Teach</hi> a Houſe in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And further yet, my Author <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> adds out of the undoubted Monuments or Lives both of <hi>Columb Cille</hi> and S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> that even as early as either of thoſe holy men's time, <hi>Loch Erne</hi> was the ſame it is now. For <hi>O Donel</hi> writes in his Life of <hi>Columb Cill</hi> l. 1. c. 88. That S. <hi>Columb</hi> by his ſpecial bleſſing and Prayer to God, obtained not only that fecundity of Fiſh to the Lake, which ever ſince it has been bleſſed with, but that the cataract or Fall of it ſhould be lower than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereby the leap of the Salmon became eaſier. And S. <hi>Ewin</hi> writes, <hi>part 2. c. 110. of S. Patric's Life,</hi> that this great Apoſtle of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to puniſh the frowardneſs of the Lord of the Countrey next adjoyning to the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern ſide of this Lake, curs'd the ſame ſide
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:102628:243"/> of it, and ſo bereav'd it of its former fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Out of which Narrations or Lives (whatſoever may be ſaid or thought of the Miracles) it is plain enough, that ſo long before theſe <hi>narrow, high, round Turrets</hi> built by the <hi>Danes, Loch Erne</hi> was the ſame it is at preſent. 5. That <hi>Ptolomee,</hi> who flouriſh'd about the year of Chriſt 153. deſcribes <hi>Loch Erne</hi> in the ſame manner, and place the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Geographers do, calling alſo the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of that Tract <hi>Erdini.</hi> 6. That nothing can be more clear and manifeſt than <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Cambden</hi>'s contradicting one another, or certainly both truth and experience each of them. For <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> plainly ſays, that the River of <hi>Ban</hi> flows out of the Lake, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to have had the foreſaid prodigious original; and <hi>Cambden</hi> no leſs plainly and poſitively averrs that Lake which had ſo ſtrange a beginning to be the Lake <hi>Erne:</hi> and yet all <hi>Ireland knows,</hi> and <hi>Cambden</hi> himſelf in ſeveral places, though more perceptibly to the eye in his Map of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhews that the ſaid River <hi>Ban</hi> flows, not out of <hi>Loch Ern,</hi> but out of another, by name <hi>Loch Neauch,</hi> which is at leaſt threeſcore miles from the Lake <hi>Ern.</hi> 7. And laſtly, that there are no ſuch <hi>Iriſh Annals</hi> known or heard of in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which impute either that cauſe or effect of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Cambden</hi> ſpeaks, to thoſe <hi>Hebridians</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:102628:243"/> by him, or to any other People or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever. So that, out of all we may ſafely conclude, the whole Relation of the foreſaid infamous Original of <hi>Loch Erne</hi> to be no better than an old Wives Tale. Which after I had lighted by chance on <hi>Gratianus,</hi> I thought my ſelf the rather obliged to obſerve here, becauſe I had formerly in writing and printing what you have in my 59 <hi>page,</hi> either ſeem'd to be ſomewhat perſuaded by the Authority of <hi>Cambden</hi> (though only ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the relation from <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> and withal telling us, I know not from whom, of <hi>Iriſh Annals</hi> in the caſe) or becauſe at leaſt I had not ſufficienly cleared ſo injurious a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
               <p>55. And now let me tell you on this occaſion, that e'n ſuch another if not yet more injurious, ill grounded, falſe Report is that which the ſame <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> is the only firſt Original Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of, in his <hi>Topography</hi> of <hi>Ireland (diſt. 3. cap.</hi> 25.) where he tells us, <q>That the People of <hi>Tirconel,</hi> a Countrey in the North of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> created their King in this barbarous abominable manner. That all being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together in one place, a white Beaſt was brought before them. Unto which he that was choſen to be made King approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, declared himſelf publickly before them all to be ſuch another, that is, a meer Beaſt.
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:102628:244"/> Whereupon the white Beaſt was cut in pieces, boil'd in Water; and, that done, a bath prepar'd for him of the Broth. Into which entring, and bathing, and then feeding, and all the People too about him feeding in the ſame manner on the fleſh boil'd in it; at laſt he drinks of that very broth wherein he had already bathed; and this alſo not by reaching or taking it out of any Cup or other Veſſel, nay not ſo much as out of the palm of his hand, but by ſtooping and putting down his mouth like a Beaſt on all ſides of the very bathing Ciſtern or Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron at large, wherein he had waſh'd. Which being over, the whole Rite and Solemnity of his inauguration was ended, and he compleatly inſtall'd in his Kingſhip of <hi>Tirconel.</hi>
                  </q> So ſays <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> intimating hereby, as if this filthy cuſtom held in that Countrey even in his own time.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Keting</hi> has abundantly refuted this no leſs filthy abominable Fiction; where he ſhews at large, in the Reign of <hi>Brian Boraimh,</hi> the known, ſolemn, decent and ſignificant Rites, yea and places too of Inaugurating every King and Prince in all the Provinces of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and who were the Lords, or which were the Families that bore the chief Offices at the reſpective Inaugurations. Particularly as to the Prince of <hi>Tirconel,</hi> namely <hi>O Donel,</hi>
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:102628:244"/> of whoſe creation this Fable of <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> muſt be underſtood, the ſame <hi>Keting</hi> ſhews that the place both of his Election or Inauguration or Inveſtiture was <hi>Cill-mhic-Creunain;</hi> and the chief Officers at it were <hi>O Fiorghaill,</hi> who carried before him and ſolemnly put into his hand the <hi>White Rod,</hi> which was his Scepter, and <hi>O Gallechuir,</hi> who was his Marſhal. But <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> (page 316 of his <hi>Cambrenſis Everſus</hi>) takes a little more pains in this particular. He tells in the firſt place, how, when any was to be created <hi>O Donel,</hi> all the Eſtates of the Countrey met together upon a certain Hill. And how, the Aſſembly being full, one of the greateſt Peers amongſt them, riſing up and ſtanding in the middle of the multitude with a pure white, ſtreight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knotty Rod in his hand, addreſs'd himſelf to the new Elect in this manner and words, <hi>Receive Sir the auſpicious Enſign of your Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and remember to imitate in your Life and Government the whiteneſs, and ſtreightneſs, and unknottineſs of this Rod: to the end no evil Tongue may find cauſe to aſperſe the candour of your Actions with blackneſs, nor any kind of corruption or tye of friendſhip be able to pervert your Juſtice. Take therefore upon you in a lucky hour the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this People, and exerciſe the Power given you hereby with all freedom and ſecurity.</hi> And how, theſe words ſpoken, he deliver'd
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:102628:245"/> the Rod into the Prince's Hand: and ſo the whole Solemnity was percloſed. In the next place <hi>Lucius</hi> deſires it may be conſider'd, that the whole controverſie in this matter with <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> may be in ſhort reduced to theſe Queries, Whether we ought to believe one Hear-ſay-mans denial before the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of very many both ear and eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Whether Domeſtick Writers, eſpecially thoſe whoſe peculiar employment, calling, charge it is are not more likely to deliver the truth of matters to Poſterity, than a meer Foreigner that not only never was in the Countrey he ſpeaks of (as <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> was never in <hi>Tirconel</hi>) but ſhews himſelf in too too many Inſtances a perfect Enemy even to all that wiſh it well? And whether we owe belief rather to publick National Records and Monuments, than to the Narration of a private man, which was not more purpoſely invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome Bard or Ballad-monger, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirouſly taken up by an invidious Writer? Thirdly to theſe and after theſe Queſtions <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> in effect anſwers and reaſons thus: That without queſtion the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chroniclers wrote of theſe matters to diſcharge the duty of their place; but <hi>Girald</hi> both in his <hi>Topographical</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Books of <hi>Ireland</hi> (ſuch as they be) yielded ſo far to paſſion, even that of extream hatred, as made him not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:102628:245"/> the Truth, but ſuppreſs it even with manifeſt Lyes and Fictions. That no indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſidering Perſon can believe, that St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> who accurately ſurveying this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Tirconel,</hi> converted all the People of it, and together with them inſtructed ſo their Prince <hi>Conall Gubhan</hi> in the auſtereſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity, that in a ſecular habit he lived an Hermits Life, would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch filthy dregs of Pagan ſuperſtition to remain, <note place="margin">Jocelin, <hi>c.</hi> 138.</note> had there been any ſuch: and this not only among the baſer obſcure ſort of <hi>Plebeians,</hi> but among the very moſt illuſtrious, the very Princes themſelves of the People. That if ſuch obvious and conſpicuous turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude had (which is not credible) eſcap'd the knowledg of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> who lived among 'em threeſcore years: aſſuredly it could by no means have eſcap'd either the notice or reprehenſion of thoſe many other Saints, who in the ſucceſſion of ſo many after-Ages of Chriſtian Religion lived in that very Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Tirconel.</hi> That above fifty eminent Saints are upon Record of thoſe deſcended from the Loins of that <hi>Conall Gubhan</hi> alone, whereof the greateſt part fix'd their dwelling there, and built alſo there above twenty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries. That the two Epiſcopal Sees of <hi>Doire</hi> and <hi>Rapoth</hi> were conſtituted in thoſe
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:102628:246"/> early days in the ſame moſt Northern Tract of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter:</hi> wherein as many Biſhops and Abbots ſucceeded one another, ſo many religious Watchmen muſt be acknowledg'd to have been viewing far and near about them in ſuch manner, as it was morally impoſſible ſo hideous, and withal ſo publick notorious a blemiſh, could all along, even for ſix hundred years compleat, till the time of <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> eſcape their animadverſion. That betwixt many of the Biſhops and Abbots of thoſe two Dioceſes, and the Lords (or Princes or Kings, which you pleaſe to call 'em) of <hi>Tirconel,</hi> there was often both very great familiar friendſhip and near kindred too. That if the reverence of the Princes did awe other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates from reprehending this naſty beſtial ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of their creation: undoubtedly, at leaſt among their kinſmen Prelates, ſome would have been found that out of Nature and for the ſake of conſanguinity would have admoniſh'd them, and procured the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. That no man can believe, that the Saints <hi>Columb-Cille, Bathenus, Laſrenus, Fergnaus, Suibhneus, Adamnanus,</hi> and other moſt holy men, who had both their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and birth, and their Education too in all Piety in <hi>Tirconel,</hi> and been ſuch fearleſs undaunted tramplers under foot of all Vice and ſuperſtition, would not have cut off by the root ſo hideous, loathſom, brutiſh a cuſtom,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:102628:246"/> if any ſuch in their days had been. That in caſe theſe great ſervants of God had wanted power enough to do ſo: yet ſurely the more powerful Saints <hi>Moelbridius</hi> and <hi>Malachias,</hi> Primats of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> who derived their extraction from that Countrey of <hi>Tirconel;</hi> would not have ſuffer'd the example to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. That heſides, it is beyond belief, That the very Princes themſelves of <hi>Tirconel,</hi> whereof ſo many were famous for Humanity, Liberality, Piety, Religion, would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd on their Princedom by ſo inauſpicious and execrable a Rite. Laſtly, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any peradventure, if they, or their People, had prov'd herein pertinacious, yet ſo many pious excellent Monarchs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as we have before ſeen, who had ſupream Authority over them, would not have connived at it. So, in effect, <hi>Lucius,</hi> againſt this equally injurious, vain, ridiculous, filthy Fiction, vented firſt of any Mortal, as the former of <hi>Loch Ern,</hi> by <hi>Girald</hi> of <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>56. Of <hi>Aonach Tailltinn</hi> the moſt celebrated <hi>Iriſh</hi> Fair, both for Antiquity and reſemblance of the <hi>Olympic</hi> Games of <hi>Greece,</hi> exhibited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (which I only mention'd in my foreſaid 95 <hi>page</hi>) the Author was <hi>Lugha Lambfhada</hi> the Twelfth King of <hi>Ireland</hi> after <hi>Slanius,</hi> but Third of the Nation called <hi>Fir-bholg,</hi> e'en ſo long ſince as betwixt two and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before the <hi>Mileſians</hi> conquer'd that
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:102628:247"/> Kingdom. The occaſion this: When the Ninth and laſt <hi>Fir-bholgian</hi> King of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Dela,</hi> by name <hi>Eoghan,</hi> was kill'd in Battel, and the Kingdom ſeiz'd by new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders, the Nation of <hi>Tuadedainin,</hi> it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd that <hi>Tailtinn</hi> Daughter to <hi>Madhmor</hi> King of <hi>South-Spain,</hi> but Widow and Queen to the ſaid <hi>Eoghan,</hi> having married <hi>Eochadh Garbb</hi> a Nobleman of the new Conquerors, bred the foreſaid <hi>Lugha</hi> with great care and kindneſs in his youth. Wherefore he, when he came to the Crown, retaining thereof a moſt grateful remembrance, and holding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound to requite her love in the beſt manner he could, thought fit to ordain, as accordingly he did, for a perpetual memory of her, one and thirty days in all, <hi>viz.</hi> the fifteen immediately preceding our firſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the other fifteen next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, to be ſolemnly kept in all Ages both by a general concourſe of the braveſt men out of all parts of the Kingdom, at a place in <hi>Meath</hi> called <hi>Tailtinn</hi> from her name, and by all ſorts of manly Games and Exerciſes there, as thoſe of Running, Hunting, Wreſtling, Leaping, Vaulting, Tilting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by prizes alſo given to the Victors. That ſo lately before the <hi>Engliſh Conqueſt,</hi> as the year 1168. <hi>Ruaruidh O Conchavair</hi> the laſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarch held this great Fair of <hi>Tailtinn</hi> and exhibited thoſe <hi>Olympick</hi> Games with much
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:102628:247"/> ſolemnity. For ſo <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> has told us in his <hi>Roman</hi> phraſe, <hi>Ludos Taltinos dedit,</hi> as we have ſeen elſewhere. And the ſame Author adds, That the Calends or firſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> though in after-times among Chriſtians, at leaſt thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, dedicated to the <hi>Chains</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Calendar, call'd <hi>Petri ad Vincula,</hi> has nevertheleſs in all Ages been, as it is at preſent, in memory of the foreſaid King, by all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation call'd in their Language <hi>Lugh-Naſa,</hi> which imports in Engliſh the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Lewis;</hi> for <hi>Naſa</hi> is remembrance, and <hi>Lugh,</hi> the ſame with <hi>Lewis</hi> or <hi>Luis.</hi> But <hi>Keting</hi> ſays that Queen <hi>Tailtinn,</hi> whom he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd ſo much, had been his own Wife; though whether in a third Venture, or no, he does not ſay.</p>
               <p>57. There is mention made (<hi>page</hi> 122 and 213) of the Monarch <hi>Ollamh Fodhlas</hi>'s having ordain'd in every Town a Receiver and Entertainer of Strangers. But the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of that Ordinance and practice of it as I find them in <hi>Keting</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> being very ſingular, I thought fit to give here, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe the Character of <hi>Gens inhoſpita,</hi> (that is, an <hi>inhoſpitable Nation</hi>) is given the <hi>Iriſh</hi> by <hi>Gerald</hi> of <hi>Wales (Top. diſt. 3. cap.</hi> 10.) ſo much againſt Truth. And certainly, for what concerns the more ancient times, it will appear out of what here follows of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:102628:248"/> care to provide entertainment for all Comers, that their Hoſpitality in thoſe days of yore was unmatchable in <hi>Europe.</hi> I am ſure it was ſo in any place or Countrey that ever I have read of. The dignity of an Entertainer, ſays <hi>Lucius,</hi> no where elſe uſed, was among the <hi>Iriſh</hi> beſtow'd only on thoſe deſcended of Noble Families. Nor was any capable of it, that was not Lord <hi>Proprietary</hi> of ſeven Towns, I mean <hi>Feeding Towns,</hi> (as <hi>Keting</hi> ſays, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> call in their Language all towns whatſoever properly ſuch; <hi>Bailte Biatha;</hi>) each Town conſiſting of twelve Plow-lands of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Meaſure, which is three or four times twelve of <hi>Engliſh.</hi> He muſt beſides have had ſeven Ploughs continually going, and withal been Maſter of ſeven Herds of Cows, each Herd conſiſting of a hundred and twenty full. His Manſion Houſe ſo ſeated, as to have been acceſſible by four ſeveral ways. A Hog, a Sheep, a Beef, always ready in the Pot, or on the Spit, to the end that every hour without delay, whoever came might be inſtantly fed. The like number of Beaſts ready kill'd and fley'd, to be put to the fire as the former was taken up. Every order and degree of men, according to their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, had their Entertainment, both meat and drink, aſſign'd by Rule, ſo as the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainer, if he defrauded any was certain to
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:102628:248"/> be fined for it, by the proportionable leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his immunities and other Priviledges. Sundry ſorts of drinks, were ſerv'd in ſundry ſorts of Cups. In Glaſs, Wine: in Braſs, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: in Silver, Whey: in white Cups of Aſh, Beer: and in brown ones made of Fig-tree, Milk. Hitherto <hi>Lucius</hi> (in his <hi>Camb. Everſ. page</hi> 130.) Who yet farther adds in the ſame place, out of <hi>Keting,</hi> what you will peradventure no leſs, if not much more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, the exceeding great number of thoſe <hi>Free-coſt</hi> entertaining Towns, or Houſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in ſuch Towns by the publick, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Ireland.</hi> In <hi>Connaght</hi> 900. in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> the like number: in <hi>Leinſter,</hi> 930. in <hi>Mounſter</hi> a 1030.</p>
               <p>58. In my 217 <hi>page,</hi> there is likewiſe upon a far other occaſion ſome little mention made of the victorious Monarch <hi>Tuathal Teatcht<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mhor,</hi> though much more elſewhere before in one or two places. However this place is that which as I was reviewing it, has brought to my remembrance what follows here out of <hi>Keting.</hi> As 1. That before his time, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was equally divided into <hi>Mounſter, Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Connaght,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi> each of theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions meeting at a place, and of the ſides of a great ſtone fix'd in that place, called <hi>Viſneach,</hi> which is in the Countrey that goes now by the name of <hi>Weſt Meath.</hi> 2. That
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:102628:249"/> when he had after twenty five years war to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſubdued the <hi>Plebeian</hi> Rebels, and reſtor'd both the Gentry to their Eſtates, and the true Royal Blood and Heirs to their reſpective Provincial Kingdoms, he thought fit to take, as he accordingly did, with their conſent, from each of thoſe Diviſions a conſiderable Tract of ground, which was the next adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Viſneach:</hi> one <hi>Eaſt,</hi> an other <hi>Weſt,</hi> a third <hi>South</hi> and the fourth on the North of it: and appointed all four, under the name of <hi>Meath</hi> (but as comprehending our Counties now of Eaſt and Weſt-<hi>Meath</hi>) to belong for evermore to the Monarchs own peculiar De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, for the maintenance of his Table. 3. That on thoſe four ſeveral portions, he built four ſeveral Kingly Pallaces, for himſelf and his Heirs, <hi>viz. Tleaghtghae</hi> on that of <hi>Mounſter</hi> ſide; <hi>Tailltin</hi> Houſe, on <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi>'s; an other at <hi>Tarach,</hi> on <hi>Leinſter</hi>'s portion; and the fourth on the Weſt of <hi>Viſneach,</hi> taken from <hi>Connaght:</hi> ordaining withal great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities at each of them to be kept on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain days yearly for ever. At <hi>Tlaghtghae</hi> the ſacred but Idolatrous Fire to be kindled on our <hi>All Hallows</hi> Eve. All Magitians of the Kingdom to come thither that night, and ſacrifice to their Deities in that Fire. All the other Fires throughout the Kingdom to be put out then, and under great penalties not
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:102628:249"/> kindled again, but from or out of this holy Fire of <hi>Tlaghtghae.</hi> And every houſe in the Kingdom, as receiving from this new conſecrated Fire, and becauſe the ground of <hi>Tleaghthae</hi> had been formerly the <hi>Mounſter</hi> King's Dominion, to pay him yearly three pence for ever. At <hi>Viſneach</hi> Houſe, or that which he had built hard by and Weſt of it on the ground taken from the <hi>Connaght</hi> King; he ordained, That each <hi>May</hi> day for ever, a general Meeting of all the Nobility ſhould be held, (which Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they call'd in their Language <hi>Morhail Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neach;</hi> and it may be Engliſh'd, <hi>the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Viſneach.</hi>) That two great Fires ſhould be made at this Meeting, and betwixt them both all beaſts ſacrific'd to their great God <hi>Beile</hi> (which <hi>Keting</hi> conceives to have been the ſame with <hi>Belus</hi>) for expiating their ſins, appeaſing his wrath, and obtaining from him favour for the following year. That the ſame day and hour, in every Diſtrict or Territory of the whole Kingdom, two ſuch other Fires ſhould be made for the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that is for all the reſpective Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to reſort unto them with their Heathen Prieſts and ſacrifices. In fine, that every Chieftain and perſon of Quality come to the ſaid great Meeting at <hi>Viſneach,</hi> ſhould preſent the <hi>Connaght</hi> King with a Horſe and compleat harneſs for a Horſeman, as a Chiefry reſerv'd
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:102628:250"/> to him for that ground. Where <hi>Keting</hi> adds, that from theſe yearly Paganical Fires at <hi>Viſneach,</hi> and elſewhere, made in thoſe days of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to honour <hi>Beall,</hi> it is that ever ſince, even along to this very day, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> call the firſt of May <hi>Lae Beall-tine,</hi> which imports in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh <hi>Beali's Fire day:</hi> for in their Tongue <hi>Lae</hi> is day, and <hi>Tine</hi> is Fire. At, or near the Palace of <hi>Tailltionn,</hi> he by a new Ordinance of his own commanded the ancient Fair, called <hi>Aonach Tailltinn</hi> (whereof we have ſpoke before) to be kept yearly on <hi>Lammas</hi> day with much more ſolemnity and a far greater conflux of people than ever. And there it was that Wedding-matches were uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally treated, agreed upon, concluded betwixt the Parents of young Folks. And by this Monarchs new Law, every couple, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying there, paid ſix ſhillings eight pence (which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> then did call <hi>Vinghe Airgiod,</hi> an ounce of Silver) to the King of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> as an acknowledgment of his having former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been Lord of that portion. But for <hi>Tarach</hi> (alias <hi>Teambhuir</hi>) where he had built his fourth Royal Palace, I find nothing ordained by him concerning any ſolemnity or Aſſembly there. And the reaſon (I ſuppoſe) might be, that even the very greateſt and moſt ſolemn Aſſembly of all the Eſtates in Parliament, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make new Laws, and repeal the old,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:102628:250"/> or to exerciſe any other Acts of Supream Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, had been already both by Law and Cuſtom fix'd in that place, ever ſince <hi>Ollamh Fodhlas</hi>'s Reign, that is full 1200. years, wanting only ſeventeen, before <hi>Tua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thal Teachtmhor</hi> came to be King. No more do I find any duty or Chiefry payable to the K. of <hi>Leinſter.</hi> Whereof I conceive alſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might have been, That indeed (as <hi>Keting</hi> elſewhere, and upon an other occaſion than this here, obſerves) <hi>Cairbre Niafearr</hi> the very firſt King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> had full two hundred and ſix years before <hi>Tuathal Teachtmor</hi>'s time, paſs'd away both his own right, and that of his Succeſſors after him, in the foreſaid por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Land wherein <hi>Tarach</hi> was built, and for ever made it over by way of ſale and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to <hi>Connor</hi> the firſt King of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> and his Succeſſours after him, in lieu of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Daughter by name <hi>Feilim Nua Chrothach,</hi> or <hi>Felicia</hi> the <hi>Beautiful,</hi> whom <hi>Cairbre</hi> had bought ſo dear to be his Wife. So dear I ſay, becauſe that fourth portion from <hi>Viſneach</hi> to the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Sea, being in his time, and until this bargain made, part of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd three <hi>Cantreds</hi> of Land of the very beſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> even all the Land which now goes under the name of the County of <hi>Meath</hi> (I mean <hi>Eaſt-Meath</hi>) along to <hi>Droghedagh,</hi> beſides <hi>Fingale,</hi> and all the other Lands too
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:102628:251"/> on that ſide of the River <hi>Liffy</hi> to <hi>Dublin.</hi> But if you deſire to know what, or how much Land a <hi>Cantred</hi> means, being I have told but now of three <hi>Cantreds</hi> in this Fourth portion: <hi>Cambrenſis,</hi> in his <hi>Hiber expug. l. 2. c.</hi> 18. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that as well in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> as <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Tongue, by a <hi>Cantred</hi> is meant that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or quantity of Land which uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a hundred Villages. And whether <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> diſagree in this ſignification of that word, I know not certainly, becauſe I know not how much Land <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> would aſſign to a Village, or <hi>Villa</hi> his <hi>Latin</hi> term. Of this I am certain, that <hi>Keting</hi> aſſigns (according to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> account) but thirty Feeding Towns, or <hi>Bailite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>59. My next Reflection is to correct an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which I obſerve in my 229. <hi>page.</hi> For there, (and whether through my own miſtake or the Printers, I know not) it is ſaid, That <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> the firſt Provincial King of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> was made ſo by <hi>Eochuidh Feileach</hi> the Monarch
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:102628:251"/> and Author of the <hi>Pentarchy,</hi> about 400 years before the Birth of Chriſt: whereas indeed it could not be ſo much, by at leaſt two hundred and eighteen years. Becauſe this Monarch <hi>Eochadh Feileach,</hi> who made that <hi>Connor</hi> King of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> could not make him King before himſelf was Monarch; and this he was not before the year of the World 5057. in which he kill'd his Predeceſſor and poſſeſs'd his Throne. Now, according to the Chronology of <hi>Lucius,</hi> that year of the World was juſt one hundred forty two years before the Birth of our Lord; becauſe (ſays he) this Birth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the year of the World 5199. after the deluge 2957. and in the 8th year, as ſome ſay, or (as others) in the 12th year of the Monarch of Ireland <hi>Criomthain Niadnairs</hi> Reign. Now 'tis plain, that from the year 5057, to the year 5099. no more efflux'd but 142 years.</p>
               <p>60. The review of my 229. <hi>page,</hi> and what is given there, of that happy King of Mounſter <hi>Feilim mhac Criomthain,</hi> brings to my thoughts here, a paſſage in <hi>Keting</hi> that is very lingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, both for the Author and matter of it. The Author is holy <hi>Bennin</hi> as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> call him in their Language, whom the <hi>Latins</hi> call St. <hi>Benignus,</hi> even that very beloved Diſciple of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> their great Apoſtle, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated and inſtall'd by him in his own days
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:102628:252"/> and in his own ſtead, Arch-biſhop of <hi>Ardmagh.</hi> And the matter is the magnificent and coſtly progreſs of the Kings of <hi>Caſhel</hi> in former times about <hi>Leath Cuinn</hi> and <hi>Leath Mogh</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Ireland.</hi> And, ſays <hi>Keting,</hi> it is in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Book call'd <hi>Leabhar na Geart</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Book of Rights or Dues,</hi> a Book beginning with theſe words, <hi>Dligh gach Riogh O Riogh Caſſil,</hi> and a Book written wholly by S. <hi>Benignus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf 1200 years ſince) that the particulars of that ſtately Progreſs are ſet down, as here they follow. Beſtow'd by him (that is, by the King of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> when he went that Progreſs) on the King of <hi>Cruachain</hi> a hundred Swords, a hundred Cups of Plate, a hundred Horſes, and a hundred Mantles. Receiv'd from this <hi>Cruachain</hi> or <hi>Connaght</hi> King half a years enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and the <hi>Riſing out</hi> (as they call it) of all the Countrey, waiting on him to <hi>Tirco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nail.</hi> Beſtow'd by him on the King of <hi>Cineal Gonuill,</hi> twenty Rings, twenty pair of Tables (which they call'd <hi>Fithchioll</hi>) and twenty Horſes. Received a months entertainment, and the riſing out of that Countrey, along with him to <hi>Tir-oghain.</hi> Beſtow'd by him on the King of <hi>Oileach,</hi> fifty Silver Cups, and fifty Swords. Receiv'd a months entertainment, and the waiting of the Countrey on him to <hi>Tullenoge.</hi> Beſtow'd by him on the Lord or Chieftain of <hi>Tullenoge</hi> thirty Silver Bowls, and
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:102628:252"/> thirty Swords or Lances. Receiv'd twelve days entertainment, and waiting on (as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) to <hi>Oirgialluibh.</hi> Beſtow'd by him on this King (I mean of <hi>Oirghialluibh</hi>) eight ſhirts of Mayle, ſixty Coats, and ſixty Horſes. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a months entertainment at <hi>Eambaine,</hi> with the riſing out into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> againſt <hi>Clanna Ruidhruidh.</hi> Beſtow'd by him on the King of <hi>Tarach</hi> 30 ſhirts of Mayle, thirty Rings, a hundred Horſe, and thirty Harpers. Receiv'd there a months entertainment, and the four chief. Families accompanying him thence to <hi>Dublin.</hi> Beſtow'd by him on the King of <hi>Dublin</hi> ten Women, ten Ships, and ten Horſes. Receiv'd a months entertainment, and this Kings Company into <hi>Leinſter.</hi> Beſtow'd by him on the <hi>Leinſter</hi> King thirty Cows, thirty Ships, thirty Horſes, and thirty young Maids which they termed <hi>Cumbhall.</hi> Receiv'd two months entertainment, <hi>i. e.</hi> one months from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Leinſter,</hi> and another from the <hi>Lower,</hi> which they call <hi>Jachter Laighion.</hi> Finally, to the <hi>Taniſt</hi> of the ſame <hi>Low-Leinſter,</hi> thirty Horſes, thirty ſhirts of Mayle, and 30 Swords. And this was the coſtly ſplendour of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Progreſs of the <hi>Mounſter</hi> Kings over <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in former Ages, when they thought fit to make or undertake it. Which <hi>Feidlimidius</hi> (alias <hi>Felim mhac Criomthain</hi>) King of that Province did in his Reign; and this no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:102628:253"/> ſince then the 845 year of Chriſt, for he enter'd upon that Kingdom <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 818. and retir'd from it to lead an Eremitical Life in the 27th yearafter. What the Original or Riſe of it was, or what right a Provincial King of <hi>Mounſter</hi> could pretend to ſuch a Progreſs, I do not find. Nor do I know what moved <hi>Keting</hi> to deſire the Reader not to account him the Author of the Relation. Or why ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his cuſtome elſewhere generally throughout his whole Chronicle, he quotes here the Author. It had been indeed very well, and much to be wiſh'd, that he had done ſo all along for his other Relations. But here perhaps he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thought fit to do it of purpoſe to decline the invidious Cenſure of thoſe of other Provinces, for magnifying ſo much his own Province of <hi>Mounſter</hi> without ſo good a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as <hi>Benuin</hi>'s Book. Whatever his motive was, the Relation it ſelf puts me upon ſome occaſional obſervations here; which ſhall be in all three.</p>
               <p>Firſt Obſervation; That <hi>Dublin</hi> muſt have been a conſiderable place in the days of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuinn,</hi> ſeeing it had then, or at leaſt before his time a King, and was a Kingdom of it ſelf, different from that of <hi>Leinſter.</hi> And therefore that however, or whenever it was firſt after that time deſtroy'd; yet ſurely none of thoſe three <hi>Norvegian</hi> Brethren, <hi>Amelacus, Sitaracus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Juor,</hi> was the firſt Founder, but only the Repairer
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:102628:253"/> and Fortifyer of it a little before the ſecond <hi>Daniſh</hi> War. In which perſuaſion I'am fix'd by conſidering that in the Chorographical Tables of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who flouriſh'd under the Emperour <hi>T. Aurelius Hadrianus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus Pius,</hi> in the year of Chriſt 153. the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Eblani,</hi> and the City <hi>Eblana</hi> is placed where <hi>Dublin</hi> has always been. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Eblana</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy</hi> is the very ſelf-ſame Town we now call <hi>Dublin;</hi> the <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, <hi>Dublinium,</hi> and <hi>Dublinia;</hi> the Welſh Britons, <hi>Dinas Dulin;</hi> the Engliſh Saxons in times paſt, <hi>Duplin:</hi> and all from one of the two original <hi>Iriſh</hi> names of it. The firſt of them was <hi>Dubh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linn,</hi> which imports a <hi>black Depth of Water</hi> that was there. And the ſecond not only was, but is ſtill among all ſorts of Iriſh, not as <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bden</hi> has it, <hi>Bala-Cleigh</hi> but <hi>Bala-Ath-Cliath,</hi> importing not the Town upon <hi>Hurdles,</hi> but the Town of the <hi>Ford</hi> of <hi>Hurdles.</hi> Which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is conſiſtent enough with the Tradition that when <hi>Dublin</hi> was firſt built, the foundation was laid upon <hi>Hurdles,</hi> by reaſon the place had been deeply mooriſh. I could here add out of <hi>Cambden,</hi> not only that <hi>Saxo Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> writes, how it was pitifully rent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Wars, but alſo that in the Life of <hi>Griffith ap Synan</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> 'tis read that <hi>Harald</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> when he had ſubdued the greateſt part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> built <hi>Deuelin.</hi> I could likewiſe add my own ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:102628:254"/> on both the one &amp; other paſſage. <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chronicles make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any <hi>Harald,</hi> either conquering any part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or building, or ſo much as repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Dublin.</hi> That neither does the Author of <hi>Polichronicon</hi> agree in the one or other point deriv'd from that Life. Nay, that according to him <hi>Sitaracus</hi> or <hi>Sitric</hi> was the <hi>Noruegian</hi> Builder of <hi>Dublin.</hi> And yet I could further add that what <hi>Cambden</hi> has next out of the foreſaid Life may be very true. For after tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, his own opinion of the above <hi>Harald</hi> to be, That he was <hi>Harald</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Harfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> i. e. of the <hi>Fair Locks</hi> or <hi>Treſſes,</hi> who was the firſt King of <hi>Norway,</hi> he adds, that his Lineal deſcent goes thus in that Life. <hi>Harald</hi> begat a Son named <hi>Auloed</hi> (alias Abloicus, Aulafus, and Olauus) <hi>Auloed begat another Auloed: this had a Son by name</hi> Sitric <hi>King of Dublin.</hi> Sitric <hi>begat</hi> Auloed, <hi>whoſe Daughter</hi> Racuella <hi>was Mother to</hi> Griffith ap Synan <hi>born at</hi> Dublin, <hi>whileſt</hi> Tirlough <hi>reign'd in</hi> Ireland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And all theſe matters, and much more rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them, I could dilate upon, were they to my purpoſe here. But they are not: becauſe my purpoſe here is only to trace up the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of <hi>Dublin</hi> as far as I can. And this I have done before out of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> by ſhewing that City to have been famous in his time, which was above 1510 years ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But how
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:102628:254"/> long before, is a thing wholly buried in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion for want of Records. And therefore I paſs to my</p>
               <p>Second Obſervation: Which is, to give the original of thoſe <hi>Clanna Ruidhruidgh</hi> againſt whom the King of <hi>Oirghillaedh</hi> (alias <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riel</hi>) with his People was bound to wait on the <hi>Mounſter</hi> Kings in their Progreſs. And this I do becauſe their name is very frequent both in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Hiſtories, and in all the Provinces of <hi>Ireland,</hi> among the ancient <hi>Iriſh</hi> Septs, even at this very time. In ſhort, as their name, turn'd <hi>Engliſh,</hi> muſt be <hi>the Children or deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Roderick</hi> (for thus we render the <hi>Iriſh</hi> name <hi>Ruadruidh:</hi>) ſo they had that name, as they lineally derive their deſcent, not from either of the two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchs call'd by that name (though, to paſs by the later, who was the very laſt of all the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Kings of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet the former of them was ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the LXX. Monarch in order of the ſame <hi>Mileſian</hi> Race, who came to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the year of the World 4907, that is before the birth of Chriſt 392 years) but much earlier, from <hi>Ruadhruidh mhac Sithghe</hi> that deſcended from <hi>Ir</hi> one of the eight Sons of <hi>Mileſius.</hi> Which <hi>Ir</hi> being dead before, or at leaſt upon the firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of <hi>Ireland</hi> betwixt the two ſurviving Brothers, <hi>Heber</hi> and <hi>Herimon,</hi> and their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins:
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:102628:255"/> and the foreſaid <hi>Ruidhruidh mhac Sitghe</hi> ſucceeding in the Lot. of <hi>Ir,</hi> which was in the <hi>North,</hi> he eſtabliſh'd both himſelf and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity there: and in proceſs of time became the great ſtock of a moſt numerous warlike ſtubborn People (and among 'em, Lords, and Princes and Kings too) whereof ſuch as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill within that portion of <hi>Ir</hi> &amp; Northern Diviſion, are by the reſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> call'd <hi>Na Faoir <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lltaigh,</hi> which words import in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>the right <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter men.</hi> And not only they that ſo remain'd within that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> Lot, but thoſe that iſſued from them into the other Provinces of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where many of 'em acquir'd large Territories, have always gone under the name of <hi>Clanna Ruidhruidh,</hi> and by it are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd ſtill from all other Families deſcended either from <hi>Herimon,</hi> or <hi>Heber,</hi> or <hi>Ith,</hi> or any elſe whatſoever of thoſe very firſt <hi>Mileſian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours. Of thoſe of them who had ſo iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued forth into other Provinces, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny of <hi>Connall Cearnach</hi> in <hi>Leaſe,</hi> a Territory of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and thoſe Septs in <hi>Connaght,</hi> which go by the peculiar name of <hi>Comhaicne Chon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacht,</hi> beſides other Families in <hi>Corcaigh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruadh</hi> and <hi>Kiarruigh;</hi> parts of <hi>Mounſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Third Obſervation is, That ſo many rich Preſents made in one Progreſs by a Provincial King, muſt argue <hi>Ireland</hi> to have been at leaſt in thoſe days of Paganiſm whereof <hi>Benuinn</hi>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:102628:255"/> writes (for he himſelf flouriſh'd about 1200 years ſince) a Countrey fraught with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Riches. And verily there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other ſtrong arguments to perſuade us, it was ſo. 1. The golden Mines diſcover'd there, under the X. Monarch of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, by name <hi>Tighernmhais,</hi> and a long time after made uſe of. In ſo much, that the Countrey abounding with gold, the next Monarch after him, viz. <hi>Munemhon,</hi> who died in the year of the World 3872. ordain'd, that all the Gentry ſhould wear golden chains about their Necks. And his next Succeſſor <hi>Aller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoid</hi>'s reign is noted in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chronicles, for golden Rings therein firſt uſed in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. The great number of <hi>Silver ſhields</hi> made by the command of <hi>Euno Airgtheach,</hi> the Xvii. Monarch of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Conqueſt, and together with Caroches and Horſes beſtow'd by him on perſons of Worth. He reign'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, and in the year of the world 3882. was kill'd in Battel by his ſucceſſour, having firſt derived from thoſe <hi>Silver Targets</hi> the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Airgtheach,</hi> which imports <hi>Silver'd.</hi> 3. The numerous company of Goldſmiths every where in that Kingdom. I am ſure that as <hi>Keting,</hi> (in <hi>Tighernmhais</hi>'s reign) takes ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of his name who was the very firſt Maſter <hi>Goldſmith</hi> in thoſe days: ſo does <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> enough of latter days, I mean
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:102628:256"/> as to that matter of the great number of Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths in 'em among the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> For in his 118. <hi>p.</hi> he obſerves out of <hi>O Duuegan</hi> that even S. <hi>Patric</hi> had in his own private Family of them at work three, namely <hi>Eſſuus, Bidus</hi> and <hi>Taſſachus.</hi> He further adds, that ſcarce in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may be found an inſtance of any Chalices, Vials, or Utenſils whatſoever dedicated to holy uſes at the Altar or in the Church, other than of pure Gold or Silver. Beſides, that the very coverings not only of Reliques but of Books, all of Silver and Gold, were ſo many throughout that Kingdom ſince it became Chriſtian, as might eaſily perſuade any indifferent man, that of neceſſity their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Goldſmiths muſt have been very great. 5. The ſpoils of foreign Countreys, which for ſo many long Ages the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd home to <hi>Ireland,</hi> as elſewhere in this Treatiſe has been ſaid. 5. Their being ſo excellently ſeated for Trading, that in thoſe days of old they were mightily frequented by Merchants out of <hi>Spain, France, Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> &amp;c. but without queſtion much more than <hi>Great Brittain</hi> was. For proof we have the teſtimony of ſo knowing and ſure a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> in his Life of <hi>Agricola:</hi> where ſpeaking of <hi>Ireland</hi> in reference to <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> he has theſe words, <hi>Melius aditus por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſque per commercia &amp; negotiatores cogniti,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:102628:256"/> That the Havens and Ports of <hi>Ireland</hi> were better known by Commerce and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants than thoſe of <hi>Brittain.</hi> 6. The ounce of Gold yearly paid for every Noſe in <hi>Ireland</hi> to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Victors whilſt their Dominion laſted there: which alſo we have ſeen before out of <hi>Keting.</hi> 7. The acknowledgment of <hi>Gerald</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> himſelf, even for his own time, that is, for the time following the horrible deſolation of that Countrey by the long and cruel <hi>Daniſh</hi> Wars, and the frequent continual plundering of it by the <hi>Norvegians</hi> and other <hi>Eaſterlings</hi> for about a hundred and fifty years at leaſt. Yet <hi>Gerald,</hi> who in the ſecond or third Age after ſo much Riches had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away thence by thoſe plundering Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, was an Eye-witneſs himſelf of what remain'd ſtill even in King <hi>Hen.</hi> II. reign, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes that <hi>Ireland</hi> at this very time abounded with Gold. For <hi>Aurum quoque quo abundat Inſula</hi> are his own words, <hi>Expug. Hib.</hi> l. 2. c. 15. where, if you joyn with it his ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter, you may obſerve him not only in three ſeveral places referring to and exaggerating this very ſubject of the <hi>Iriſh Gold,</hi> but withal ſuppoſing in the laſt of them, that without <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commodities &amp; Commerce our Iſland of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> could not ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I might peradventure to the ſame purpoſe of ſhewing the plenty of Treaſure
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:102628:257"/> among the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and that even but a very little time before the days of <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> (I am ſure I might pertinently enough for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their liberality and Piety both, extended even to Forein Parts) alleadg out of the Chronicle of St. <hi>James's Benedictin Cloiſter</hi> ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Weſt-gate of <hi>Reinsburg</hi> (alias <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbona</hi>) in <hi>Germany,</hi> thoſe vaſt ſums of Gold and Silver, beſides the great proportion of other rich Donaries beſtow'd by the <hi>Mounſter</hi> King <hi>Conchabhar O Brien</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Slapparſalach</hi> and other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Princes upon <hi>Dionyſius, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus</hi> and <hi>Gregorius,</hi> three ſucceſſive <hi>Iriſh</hi> Abbots of that Cloiſter, and ſent unto them by their own <hi>Iriſh</hi> Meſſengers come of purpoſe out of <hi>Germany,</hi> at three ſeveral times, and with the Emperour <hi>Conrad</hi>'s Letters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending them that came laſt. Unto thoſe and theſe Meſſengers was delivered ſo great and Royal a ſum by the foreſaid King of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> that thereby this Cloiſter was from the very foundations not only re-built in a little time ſo magnificently, that for the ſtatelineſs of the Work, it ſurpaſs'd all other to be ſeen in thoſe days any where; but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, to maintain it and the Monks therein for ever, purchaſed both within that very City of <hi>Reinsburg,</hi> and abroad in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in Houſes, Lands, Villages, Towns, a mighty great Revenue and perpetual Eſtate.
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:102628:257"/> And yet after all [<hi>ſupererat ingens copia pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae Regis Hiberniae</hi>] there was remaining ſtill an exceeding great quantity of the King of <hi>Ireland</hi>'s money, ſays the ſaid Chronicle. For ſo that Author calls the above <hi>Conchabhar O Brien,</hi> though only King of <hi>Mounſter:</hi> the time of whoſe Reign was from the year of Chriſt 1127. when it began, to the year 1142. when he ended both it and together with it his Life in a Pilgrimage at <hi>Kildare.</hi> I ſay nothing of the mighty rich Preſents, which he ſent, and were carried from him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in his name to the Emperour <hi>Lotharius</hi> the II. by ſome of the nobleſt Peers of <hi>Ireland</hi> who had receiv'd the Croſs for going to the holy War at that time in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are two particulars, which on this occaſion coming to remembrance, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs over in ſilence. The one is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> a famous man among the Learned, ſpecially Chronologers. For in that <hi>Reinsburg</hi> Chronicle, which ſpeaks of <hi>Gregory,</hi> the third of thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Abbots now mention'd, we have this account of him. 1. That after the ſame <hi>Gregory,</hi> upon the death of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſour <hi>Chriſtianus,</hi> was choſen Abbot to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in the foreſaid Cloiſter of <hi>Reinsburg,</hi> and therefore gone to <hi>Rome</hi> to be conſecrated by the Pope, who then was <hi>Adrian</hi> IV. an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, at that very time turn'd Monk
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:102628:258"/> in this Cloiſter <hi>egregius Clericus Hibernienſis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Marianus,</hi> &amp;c. an excellent <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clerk by name <hi>Marianus</hi> a moſt learned man, who a long time at <hi>Paris</hi> had publickly taught the ſeven Liberal Arts and other Sciences; and was there Maſter to this very <hi>Adrian</hi> who now preſided in the Apoſtolical Chair at <hi>Rome</hi> when the foreſaid <hi>Gregory</hi> was admitted by him to Audience. 2. That among other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions <hi>Adrian</hi> enquiring of <hi>Gregory</hi> concerning <hi>Marianus,</hi> his old Praeceptor at <hi>Paris, Gregory</hi> anſwered him thus, Maſter <hi>Marianus</hi> is well, and having forſaken the World lives with us a Monk at <hi>Reinsburg.</hi> 3. That hereupon the Pope delivered himſelf in theſe words: <hi>God be thanked,</hi> ſays he, <hi>For throughout the Catholick Church, we do not know, under an Abbot, ſuch an other man, ſo excelling in Wiſdom, Prudence, Wit, Eloquence, good manners, humanity, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and other divine gifts, as my Maſter</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hitherto the very words of that <hi>Reinsburg</hi> Chronicle, done only into <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Which I have therefore given here (out of <hi>Camb. Everſ. page</hi> 164.) becauſe I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore that famous man to his own native Countrey <hi>Ireland,</hi> notwithſtanding his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Scotus.</hi> What time he flouriſh'd we may gather hence: being we know that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> IV. whoſe Inſtructor in the Sciences he was, died in the year of Chriſt 1159. the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:102628:258"/> fourth year and tenth month of his Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>
               <p>The other particular ſhews how the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had been five hundred years before piouſly munificent to Foreiners come to lead religious lives with them at home in <hi>Ireland:</hi> as we have but lately ſeen they were five hundred years after to thoſe of their own Natives that devoted themſelves wholly to the ſame Life among Foreiners abroad. I muſt confeſs there are many more Inſtances in Hiſtory to ſhew the ſame thing; but this one extracted by <hi>Cambden</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cambden <hi>in his country of</hi> Maio.</note> out of <hi>V. Bede, (l. 1. Eccleſ. Hiſtor. cap.</hi> 4.) may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in this place. <hi>Colman,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Biſhop, found a place in <hi>Ireland</hi> meet for building a Monaſtery, named in the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> (that is <hi>Iriſh</hi>) Tongue <hi>Mageo.</hi> And he bought a part of it, which was not much, of the Earl whoſe poſſeſſion it was, to found a Monaſtery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: but with this condition annex'd to the ſale, that the Monks reſiding there, ſhould pray for the Soul of him that permitted them to have the place. Now when he had in a very little time, with the help of the ſaid Earl and all the Neighbour Inhabitants built this Cloiſter, he plac'd the Engliſh men there (who were thirty in number) leaving the <hi>Scots</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him in the Monaſtery which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:102628:259"/> built in a ſmall Iſle on the Weſt of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by name <hi>Inis-Bofindhe,</hi> that is, the <hi>Iſland of the white Cow.</hi> And that Cloiſter which he had built within the Land, is inhabited even at this day by <hi>Engliſh</hi> men. For it is the ſame which of a ſmall one is grown great, and uſually call'd <hi>Mageo.</hi> And now, having this good while turn'd all to better orders, it contains a notable Covent of Monks, who being aſſembled there out of the Province of <hi>England,</hi> according to the Example of the reverend Fathers, under regular diſciplin, and a Canonical Abbot, live in great continency and ſincerity by the labour of their own hands. Hitherto <hi>Bede.</hi> And <hi>Cambden,</hi> where he treats of the County of <hi>Maio</hi> in <hi>Connaght,</hi> adds, that if he deceive not himſelf, that place named <hi>Mageo</hi> in <hi>Bede,</hi> is the very ſame that now we call the Town of <hi>Maio,</hi> the Head of that Shire. Which to be true, not only the neerneſs of <hi>Inis-Bofindhe,</hi> where <hi>Colman</hi> left the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monks, whom, together with thoſe <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he took along with him from <hi>Lindis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fearn</hi> in <hi>Great Brittain</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ann 664.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon</hi> Chronology, printed with <hi>Bede</hi> by <hi>Wheloc.</hi>
                  </note>, but the right <hi>Iriſh</hi> name of <hi>Maio</hi> confirms. For in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage 'tis call'd <hi>Magheo</hi> even at this day. But 'tis high time now to end a digreſſion, which though at firſt occaſion'd by my reflecting on <hi>Felim mhac
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:102628:259"/> Criomthain</hi>'s coſtly Progreſs about <hi>Ireland,</hi> has after by degrees, of it ſelf inſenſibly ſpun out to this length.</p>
               <p>61. Although you may ſee for above four <hi>leaves</hi> together (that is from <hi>page</hi> 190, to <hi>page</hi> 199.) very much as well of the great Actions and fortunate ſucceſſes of the laſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, <hi>Ruaruidh O Conchabhair,</hi> in his youth, as of the total Ecclipſe of his glory, yea and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able change of his Royal State in his old days, to the miſerable condition of a poor, private, flitting, forlorn Exile, and all proceeding from the unnatural cruelty of his own very Son: nevertheleſs, amongſt thoſe former ſmiles of Fortune favouring him, had it occurr'd, I had ſurely mention'd the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> or <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> of all the Eſtates of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he held with great ſolemnity in the firſt year of his Reign, being the year of Chriſt 1166. at a place which <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> (in his <hi>Camb, Everſ. page</hi> 161.) calls in Latin <hi>Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boylochia;</hi> perhaps that Town which now we call <hi>Athboy</hi> in <hi>Meath,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in their Language <hi>Bale-Ath-Buoy.</hi> But which foever, or where ſoever that <hi>Athboylochia</hi> was, the Meeting there was ſo numerous, that, beſides the ſeveral peculiar Trains of the Provincial Kings and other Princes and great Nobles of Lay-degree, and of three Arch-biſhops too of the four, thirteen thouſand Horſe at one
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:102628:260"/> time were counted at it. Nor was this great, and for ought I have read, very laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Mileſians</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than it was careful to provide for the Commonwealth, by ordaining, That the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ancient good Laws, which length of time and corruption of men had brought to diſuſe, ſhould receive new vigour by a ſevere obſervance and execution of them: but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that none ſhould dare infringe the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Immunities of the Church. So in effect ſays my foreſaid Author <hi>Gratianus.</hi> But all would not do. No ordinances of men could prevent the Fate impending from Heaven over their Heads at that very time. For what is decreed by God to fall, muſt fall ſome time. And the time of their Fall had its viſible beginning the very next year, which was 1167. as I have hinted before, <hi>page</hi> 194. and you thall ſee at large in the following <hi>Second Part</hi> of his little Work.</p>
               <p>62. Reflecting upon my account of <hi>Malachias</hi> (given from <hi>page</hi> 262 to <hi>page</hi> 287 inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively) and conſidering that I have therein ſaid nothing at all of the famous Propheſie, which goes in his name, of all the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> who were to ſucceed one another from his time forward either to the day of general Judgment, or at leaſt to the final deſolation of that ſeven-Hill'd City: therefore to ſatisfie
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:102628:260"/> in ſome degree ſuch as have the curioſity and leaſure to read predictions of this kind, I thought it no great enlargement or extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, to let them know of that Propheſie what follows here. 1. That all the beſt account I have found of it hitherto, is from <hi>Thomas Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham</hi>'s Book entitled <hi>Florilegium Inſulae SS.</hi> printed at <hi>Paris</hi> an. 1624. who extracted it, as he ſays, out of <hi>Arnoldus Wion l. 2.

That by ſo many lines are ſignified ſo many Popes, and conſequently a hundred and twelve Popes in all that were to ſucceed in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, from the time (as 'tis pretended) of that Prophetie's date, until the conſummation. 4. That it names none of them, ſave only the Laſt: and for the reſt, it leaves us wholly to divine of 'em, and of each a part by the character given of him in the ſhort line anſwerable only to him by the order of times and ſucceſſion in the Holy See. 5. That one <hi>Alphonſus Giacconius</hi> of the <hi>Dominican Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:102628:261"/> has paraphras'd on the firſt threeſcore and ſixteen of thoſe prophetical Lines, in a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diſtinguiſh'd into two Columns. Wherein the ſhort Lines of the Propheſie it ſelf, plac'd in order, take up the firſt Column: the names of the Popes propheſied of, the Second; each Pope directly placed againſt the Propheſie that foretels him: and the Paraphraſes or Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, that interpret the predictions and apply them, take up the laſt, in the ſame order and oppoſition. 6. That as this Interpreter begins with <hi>Celeſtin</hi> the II. of that name, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the firſt Line of him: ſo he ends with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the VII. of whom all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie is only this, <hi>De rore caeli,</hi> which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in Engliſh is, <hi>Of the Dew of Heaven,</hi> and interpreted almoſt in as few words by <hi>Ciacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> viz. [<hi>Qui fuit Archiepiſcopus Roſſanenſis in Calabria, ubi manna colligitur.] Who was Arch-biſhop in</hi> Roſanna <hi>in</hi> Calabria <hi>where</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na <hi>is gathered.</hi> 7. That by this one Example we may both partly gueſs at the nature of the Propheſies, and plainly ſee what kind of interpretations of them thoſe of <hi>Ciacconius</hi> are. Whereof every one runs in the ſame or like manner, endeavouring to veriſie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction either in the Countrey, or Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Family, or Gentilitial Enſigns, or ſome accident happen'd to the Pope fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by it. 8. That as no man has yet ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:102628:261"/> on the interpretation of the next eleven prophetical Lines; which muſt be anſwerable to the next eleven Popes, that before the now reigning Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. have ſince <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> VII. ſucceeded in the Pontifical Chair: ſo we can hardly in our days expect any publick interpretation or application of <hi>Bellua inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilis</hi> to the ſame preſent Pope <hi>Innocent;</hi> tho it be what is anſwerable to him in thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Lines and Columns, if we take exact no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Succeſſion. 9. That, (which is more my deſign to give here) all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing number of thoſe prophetical ſhort Lines, and conſequently of Popes to ſucceed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is only twenty ſix in the whole: a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Popes not ſo very great, but that much leſs than the ordinary age of a man may ſee it over, if they ſhould prove no longer lived than many of their Predeceſſours have; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no fewer than eight in a ſucceſſion took up in all but twelve years time. 10. That for the better ſatisfaction of thoſe who may be affected with this kind of reading; and becauſe it will not take up much room, nor require any further dilatation, I give here thoſe very ſix and twenty genuin Lines, which however briefly (and obſcurely too all of 'em, except the laſt) yet in ſome prophetical manner tell us of thoſe ſix and twenty Popes to come in ſucceſſion after his Holineſs that

               <p>What remains, either of Reflection or Addition, are the few points that follow. I forgot to give them in their due places, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of <hi>pages</hi> hitherto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd: and therefore I give them here.</p>
               <p>63. The firſt relates to that famous <hi>Beann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuir</hi> Abbey in the North of <hi>Ireland;</hi> whereof I have treated before <hi>page 62, &amp;c.</hi> For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the greatneſs of it, you have here an illuſtrious teſtimony out of a forein Writer, <hi>Antony Yepez,</hi> in his general Chronicle of the <hi>Benedictin Order,</hi> ad <hi>ann. Chriſti 565. cap.</hi> 2. where ſpeaking of that <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monaſtery, he ſays in expreſs words, <hi>It was one of the greateſt our ſacred Religion</hi> (he means the Benedictin Order) <hi>had in all</hi> Europe, <hi>nay the very greateſt of all that were built in the whole Occident,</hi> and that <hi>no other was comparable to it.</hi> But for the auſterity of their lives, the ſanctity of their converſation, the power of their doctrine and example, their ſupernatural gifts; and in a word the extraordinary ſtupendious hand of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:102628:263"/> God with them in all their undertakings who were profeſs'd Votaries in that illuſtrious Cloiſter, we have no leſs forein, and much more ancient Writers than <hi>Yepez</hi> to inform us. And certainly, if we may judg of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by what ſuch credible Authors have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſome eight hundred, and ſome a thouſand years ſince of the Miſſionaries of that Abbey, the diſciples of St. <hi>Congellus</hi> (Founder and firſt Abbot thereof) ſent abroad into other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> by him, for the converſion of Infidels, and reformation of evil Chriſtians: there needs no more to convince us, that <hi>Beannchuir</hi> was a moſt perfect Seminary of the moſt truly vertuous and wonderful Monks on Earth. For Example; of St. <hi>Gallus</hi> (the <hi>Iriſh</hi> call him in their Language <hi>Gall</hi>) who was one of the twelve, that in one Miſſion, at one and the ſame time went thence with <hi>Columbanus,</hi> who was the thirteenth of them and Prefect of this Miſſion, thus writeth St. <hi>Notkerus Balbulus</hi> (in his Martyrologe 17 Cal. Nov.) <hi>that he converted the people of</hi> Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> Suevia <hi>from Idolatry: confirm'd his preaching to them with the power of Miracles: and that him the divine goodneſs made Apoſtle of the</hi> Allemaigns: <hi>as by whom that Nation which he had found enveloped in Paganiſm was enlightned with true Religion, and brought from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ignorance to the Sun of Juſtice who is
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:102628:263"/> Chriſt.</hi> So, and much more in ſhort, writeth the ſaid holy <hi>Notherus</hi> of this great Apoſtle of the <hi>Allemaigus</hi> St. <hi>Gallus,</hi> from whom or whoſe Monaſtery, the Town of St. <hi>Gall,</hi> ſo famous even at this day, hath been called. As for the particulars as well of his ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous auſterity, as Miracles above Nature, they may be ſeen at large in his Life extant in <hi>Meſſingham</hi> and <hi>Surius,</hi> written originally by <hi>Walafridus Strabo.</hi> But for <hi>Columbanus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (a <hi>Leinſter</hi> man born, and but twenty years old when he went to Sea from <hi>Beann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuir,</hi> Head of that Miſſion) whoever pleaſe to read over ſeriouſly his Acts, written about a thouſand years ſince by one of his own well-nigh Contemporaries, Abbot <hi>Jonas,</hi> muſt needs, I think, be ſuſpended in admiration of a man ſo prodigious in all reſpects. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe my ſelf, when I obſerve the whole courſe of his Life in <hi>Ireland, France, Burgundy, Allmaign,</hi> and laſt of all in <hi>Italy</hi> where he died.

But truly his baniſhment out of <hi>Burgundy</hi> by King <hi>Theodorick,</hi> at the inſtigation of the wicked Queen <hi>Brumchildis</hi> (that bane, that Murdreſs of ten Kings, for ſhe deſtroy'd ſo many, ſome by poiſon and ſome by other damnable ways) and his Journey thereupon to <hi>Italy,</hi> appear'd to be no other than a long continued Triumph for his victory over Kings and their deteſtable cruelty; yea and a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Triumph indeed, becauſe accompanied with ſo many prodigious ſigns and Wonders wrought by him every where as he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. So ſays <hi>Baronius,</hi> in the foreſaid place, wholly without doubt ſuſpended in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what himſelf does ſo relate of this ſtupendious man of God.

And then again our great Annaliſt the ſame <hi>Baronius (ad an.</hi> 615.) returning once more to that heavenly Man, and telling us of his death in <hi>Italy</hi> (after he had founded there the moſt renowned Cloiſter of <hi>Bobium,</hi> as he had formerly done before his baniſhment, that of <hi>Luxovium</hi> in <hi>Burgundy</hi>) he delivers it with this Elogium of him.

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:102628:265"/> the teſtimony of an ancient Engliſh Author, whom I ſuppoſe to have lived and died in forein parts a Monk of <hi>

Nor finally can they be ignorant how in particular, <hi>Euſtaſius Luxovienſis; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitus Resbacenſis, Faro Meldenſis, Audomarus

And the concluſion of all muſt be, that we have reaſon to think, that how great ſoever this <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cloiſter was either for the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of its buildings and ground whereon it ſtood, or for the number of Monks reſiding therein, which elſewhere we have ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to three thouſand: yet undoubtedly it was far more illuſtrious for their ſanctity and perfection of Life.</p>
               <p>64. But before I paſs to a new Subject, the Reader will give me leave to obſerve here, that <hi>Antony Yepez,</hi> notwithſtanding his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for the greatneſs of <hi>Beannchuir,</hi> has been very much out in accounting it one of his own <hi>Benedictin</hi> Order. It was the year
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:102628:266"/> of our Lord 494. that St. <hi>Benedict</hi> himſelf, in the fourteenth year of his age, retir'd from being at School in <hi>Rome</hi> to dedicate himſelf to God in a contemplative Life, as <hi>Baronius</hi> writes in the ſame year. But above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before that time, <hi>Ireland</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh'd with perfect Monks, and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s own Inſtitution: being, as we have ſeen elſewhere out of <hi>Henricus Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſiodorenſis,</hi> it was ſo before St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s death, and his death happen'd in the year 493, as <hi>Jocelin</hi> ſays. And, if neither by one of thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monks at home who had their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſtitution from St. <hi>Patric</hi> himſelf, nor by one of their immediate diſciples, yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at fartheſt very early after St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s death, it was that that ſo much celebrated <hi>Iriſh</hi> Abby of <hi>Beannchuir</hi> was founded by St. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellus;</hi> and conſequently no later than the Monaſtery of <hi>Columb-Cille</hi> at <hi>Dear-magh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame <hi>Congellus</hi> and he were contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries. Whence a further conſecution is, that <hi>Beannchuir</hi> muſt have been founded at leaſt ſome years before <hi>Columb-Cille</hi>'s depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his Monaſtery at <hi>Dearmach</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> on this Miſſion to convert the <hi>Picts</hi> in the North of <hi>Great Brittain;</hi> which departure of his, according to Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in the year of Chriſt 565. Now it is plain, that before the year of Chriſt 561.
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:102628:266"/> there is not in <hi>Baronius</hi> no not ſo much as any mention made of <hi>Benedicts</hi> ſending any of his diſciples to the Weſt, no not into <hi>France</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his Order. Nay before the year 595. his Order had receiv'd no publick approbation from the Church, not even within <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf. As for <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> 'tis no leſs clear, that the <hi>Benedictin</hi> Order was not heard of there till after <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk's coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> to convert the <hi>Saxons.</hi> And yet we know that long before his time the famous Abby of Monks at <hi>Bangor,</hi> near <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> had been founded even by the foreſaid ſelf ſame <hi>Iriſh</hi> Abbot St. <hi>Congellus,</hi> come thither of purpoſe from his own former Abby, the ſo much admired <hi>Beannchuir</hi> in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to build an other in <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> by the pattern of it. But as for <hi>Ireland,</hi> certainly not before all their own rigid auſtere Monks of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Rule, and <hi>Congheall</hi>'s and <hi>Collumb Cille</hi>'s inſtitution had been utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy'd by the long <hi>Daniſh</hi> Wars, nor after neither till about the time of <hi>Malachias,</hi> that is even five hundred years at leaſt after the foundation of <hi>Beannchuir,</hi> was any <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictin</hi> Abbey there. So far is <hi>Yepez</hi> from any juſt pretence to <hi>Beannchuir,</hi> or juſt challenge to it in behalf of his <hi>Benedictin</hi> Order. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I think nothing can be plainer, than that St. <hi>Columbanus,</hi> and <hi>Gallus</hi> with thoſe
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:102628:267"/> other eleven holy Fellow miſſioners, ſent out of the ſame <hi>Beannchuir</hi>-Abbey into forein parts to preach the Goſpel (as has been ſaid before) were of the ſame Order that was profeſs'd in that Cloiſter, being they were themſelves profeſs'd ſons and members of it under the ſame bleſſed Abbot <hi>Congellus,</hi> with whoſe leave and benediction they departed from it on their miraculous fruitful Miſſion beyond Seas. And ſure I am that <hi>Ordericus Vitalis Angligena,</hi> in his eighth Book of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> near the end, as <hi>Meſſingham</hi> quotes him, denies they were of the <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctin</hi> or any other Inſtitution than that was peculiar to themſelves and thoſe of their own Followers in <hi>France, Burgundy,</hi> &amp;c. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I think it no leſs manifeſt that if the ſaid illuſtrious Abbey of <hi>Beannchuir</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> had been of the <hi>Benedictin</hi> Order, ſo muſt alſo <hi>Bangor</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> have been: ſeeing they had both the ſame Founder, to wit the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Congheall,</hi> or (as they call him in Latin) <hi>Congellus.</hi> And yet to aſſert this of <hi>Bangor</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> muſt be againſt all reaſon. Becauſe we know <hi>Bangor</hi> has been ſo far from any <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> Order, that <hi>Dinooth</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot and other Learned men thereof, were the grand ſticklers againſt ſubmitting to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Pontiff himſelf, though ſo good a man and Pontiff both, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> was
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:102628:267"/> known to be. For they were the men pitch'd and relied upon by the <hi>Britons</hi> to be, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly were, as to matter of Learning, the chiefeſt oppoſers of <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Firſt Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the Conferences he had with the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops, to bring them to ſome acknowledgment of and ſubmiſſion to the Pope. And it is no way probable, that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nooth</hi> or his Monks, if they had been of the <hi>Benedictin</hi> Order, would have ſo fiercely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his Legat, eſpecially in point of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical ſubmiſſion to the Delegant himſelf, whoſe only authority was it which gave being and credit to the ſame Order, by confirming it ſo lately before in a <hi>Roman</hi> Council. Much leſs would their fierceneſs and reſolution in that matter have been ſo unalterable as to occaſion the ſlaughter of eleven hundred and fifty of their Brethren Monks of the very ſame <hi>Bangor</hi> Abbey at one time and place. Whereof you may ſee the particulars in <hi>Venerable Bede, l. 2. Eccl. Hiſtor.</hi> c. 2. and in <hi>Whelock</hi>'s Notes upon this Chapter. So that <hi>Yepez</hi> in making <hi>Beannchuir</hi> a <hi>Benedictin</hi> Abbey, knew not what he ſaid, or at leaſt what could be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
               <p>65. Why the <hi>Staff of Jeſus,</hi> mention'd in my 273. <hi>page,</hi> was ſo called, you may read in <hi>Jocelinus,</hi> an Engliſh Monk that five hundred years ſince, at the inſtance of two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Biſhops,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:102628:268"/> and Sir <hi>John Curcy</hi> (whom he calls Prince of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> becauſe (as I ſuppoſe) he was the firſt Conqueror of it under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown) digeſted the Life of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> out of many former Lives written of Him by ſeveral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but written by them in ſuch manner and ſtile as did not invite Readers. It is therefore this <hi>Jocelinus,</hi> that in his Life of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> cap. 24. gives a pretty large account of that <hi>Staff of Jeſus.</hi> Which is, in ſubſtance. That when St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> after a long abode of many years with St. <hi>German</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Altiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorum</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> had with his leave at laſt departed towards <hi>Rome,</hi> in his journey thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, either by divine inſtinct or Angelical inſtruction, diverted to a certain Iſland in the <hi>Tirrhene</hi> Sea, of purpoſe to viſit a certain holy Anchoret of great ſame living there, whoſe name was <hi>Juſtus.</hi> 2. That upon his arrival, after holy ſalutes and ſpiritual conference, <hi>Juſtus</hi> gave him a Staff, ſaying, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it from the very hand of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; but to be given him. 3. That after this, St. <hi>Patrick</hi> diſcourſing with other men, who lived in the ſame Iſland at ſome little diſtance from the Cell of <hi>Juſtus,</hi> whereof ſome appeared brisk and young, others old even to decrepit age: and underſtanding that thoſe extream old men he ſaw were the very genuin ſons of thoſe other that appear'd
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:102628:268"/> young: and enquiring how that could be? One of the ſame young men, both to remove his admiration which was great, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his demand, gave him this anſwer. <hi>We</hi> (ſays he) from our childhood, through the mercy of God, have been always given to works of mercy: and our door was open to every Traveller, that for Chriſt's ſake deſired either Victuals or Lodging. On a certain Night we received a ſtranger with a Staff in his hand, and according to our beſt ability treated him with all neceſſaries and kindneſs. Next Morning, upon his departure he bleſſed us; nor only bleſſed us, but moreover ſpake theſe words unto us, <hi>viz.</hi> I am Jeſus Chriſt, whom in perſon you have this Night receiv'd into your Houſe, who ſo often before have receiv'd me in my ſervants. And then he delivered the Staff he had in his hand, to the man of God our ſpiritual Father: commanding him to keep it for a certain Pilgrim, by name <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,</hi> who after many days ſhould arrive here, and upon him to beſtow it. Which command given, he preſently aſcended into Heaven: and we have ever ſince remained in the ſame ſtate of youthful countenance, briskneſs and vigour of body we were in at that time. But our ſons that were but little children then, are now according to their age come to be decrepit, as you ſee them. 4. That when
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:102628:269"/> St. <hi>Patrick</hi> had heard all, he gave God thanks: and after a few days longer converſation with <hi>Juſtus,</hi> proceeded on his Journey, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in his hand that holy Staff appointed by God himſelf to be an inſtrument for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Patrick</hi> to work therewith prodigious things in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as the Rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> had formerly been for effecting the famed Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in <hi>Egypt:</hi> the greateſt difference betwixt them being, that <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> brought health and life to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, but <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> death upon the <hi>Egyptian.</hi> So in effect <hi>Joce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> moſtly concerning the original of that <hi>Staff.</hi> Unto which he addeth (<hi>cap.</hi> 170.) concerning alſo the powerful Virtue of it, That by lifting it up on high, and threatning with it, St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> after a long Faſt of forty days and forty nights, join'd with continual fervent Prayer, forc'd together out of all parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> all venomous Animals whatſoever, to the Mountain call'd in Iriſh <hi>Cruachain Ailge,</hi> in the Weſt of <hi>Conaght,</hi> and from thence precipitated them into the Weſtern Ocean, lying under this Mountain: and this with ſuch a bleſſed riddance to the whole Iſland, as to have left or have rendred it ever ſince incapable of harbouring any creature alive that were Poiſonous, though brought into it from other Countreys.</p>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:102628:269"/>
               <p>How <hi>Keting</hi> underſtands this later point. we have ſeen before.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for <hi>Gerald</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> though he acknowledg both the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and name of that Staff, calling it <hi>Virtuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſimum baculum Jeſu,</hi> the <hi>moſt powerful Staff of Jeſus;</hi> yet he ſays withal, that the Origin of it is as uncertain as the Virtue is moſt certain. Adding immediately in the ſame place, That in his own time, and by his own Countrey men the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Conquerours, that noble Treaſure (for ſo he calls it) was tranſlated from <hi>Ardmagh</hi> to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What became of it ſince, I cannot tell. But this I find in St. <hi>Bernards</hi> Life of <hi>Malachias,</hi> that this <hi>Staff of Jeſus,</hi> and the Text of the Goſpel that was St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s own Book, or that uſed by himſelf, were the two moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewels not only of the Church of <hi>Ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> but of any in the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> That they were held by all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the greateſt veneration above all other holy Reliques whatſoever; but more eſpecially the <hi>Staff,</hi> as being that which our Saviour Chriſt himſelf had both carried in his own divine hand, fram'd by his own peculiar workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and recommended in ſuch a ſpecial manner to be given to his Apoſtolical ſervant <hi>Patrick.</hi> I find moreover in <hi>David Rooth,</hi> the late <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory</hi>'s Eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations upon <hi>Jocelin,</hi> whatever may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected

That Sir <hi>James Ware</hi> in his Catalogue of the Kings of <hi>Ireland</hi> lately publiſh'd, makes no mention at all of <hi>Turgeſius.</hi> 2. That the Annals of <hi>Ireland</hi> place both the end of <hi>Niall Caille</hi>'s Reign, and the beginning of <hi>Maolſeachluinn</hi> I. in the year of our Lord 844. But, as to the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> neither of theſe arguments, nor any other which I have yet ſeen, evince more than that the <hi>Interregnum</hi> was very ſhort, and concluded with one year.</p>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:102628:271"/>
               <p>67. The ſecond Note muſt refer to <hi>p. 222, &amp;c.</hi> where the Subject treated is the true Chriſtian religious great Vertues indeed of as many <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchs, or Kings of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> as I have remembred there. but the addition to them here is only of two more, <hi>viz. Ainmirus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Sedna,</hi> and <hi>Donnaldus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Aidus.</hi> For ſo they are call'd in <hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Gratianus Lucius:</hi> though in <hi>Iriſh</hi> their names and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names are <hi>Ainmhire mhac Seadhna,</hi> who was the XI. and <hi>Domhnall mhac Aodh Slaine,</hi> who was the Xviii. Chriſtian King of all <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former, com to the Sovereignty in the year of Chriſt 563. but parted from it, and his life too, by a horrible murther committed on him in the fourth year of his Reign, was ſo Chriſtianly zealous for the purity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Rites, Diſcipline, Church, that he could not abide the leaſt blemiſh, ſpot or wrinkle in any of them. In ſo much, that in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Hiſtories it is ſpecially recorded of him to his great honour, how, when he had obſerv'd ſome things amiſs in the Rituals, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſome Errours crept in, or ſome deviation from the Rules preſcrib'd them, though but ſo lately before, by their great Apoſtle St. <hi>Patrick:</hi> and when about the ſame time he had heard by fame of the excellent knowledg, integrity, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, wiſdom of <hi>Gildas</hi> in <hi>Great Brittain;</hi> he ſent his own Letters to invite him to <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                  <pb n="476" facs="tcp:102628:272"/> towards the reforming there whatever had been ſo amiſs. But why <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> here, gives the ſurname of <hi>Badonicus</hi> to <hi>Gildas</hi> (for he calls him <hi>Gildas Badonicus)</hi> I confeſs I do not know, nor can conjecture, unleſs perhaps that Northern Mountainous Countrey (in <hi>Yorkſhire)</hi> now call'd <hi>Blackemere</hi> in Engliſh, but formerly in Latine <hi>Mons Badonicus</hi> has been the native Countrey of this ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This I know, that in <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> he is ſurnamed <hi>Sapiens,</hi> or <hi>Gildas</hi> the <hi>Wiſe.</hi> And moreover, that <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> (l. 3. <hi>Hiſt. Angl.)</hi> writes how <hi>Gildas</hi> himſelf has told us his little Book (<hi>de excidio Brittannico)</hi> that himſelf was born that very year wherein the <hi>Britons</hi> had obtain'd againſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Victory at <hi>Mons Badonicus,</hi> which was the forty fourth year after the firſt landing of <hi>Hengiſtus</hi> and <hi>Horſus,</hi> being the year of Chriſt 492. Unto which if we joyn what the ſame <hi>Polydore</hi> had ſaid before (<hi>l. 1. Hiſt. Angl.)</hi> of <hi>Gildas,</hi> viz. That he flouriſh'd about the year of Chriſt 580. we may conclude, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the time ſet down in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Books for his going to <hi>Ireland,</hi> as invited thither by the foreſaid Monarch <hi>Ainmhire mhac Sedhna,</hi> agrees full well with this time and age of <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> then.</p>
               <p>The later of theſe two Monarchs, namely <hi>Domhnal,</hi> ſon to <hi>Aodh Slaine,</hi> who not only
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:102628:272"/> came with pure hands without blood to the Crown, but after fourteen year's glorious Reign firſt, and then eighteen months ſickneſs, parted with Crown and life together peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly on his Bed (which was in that Nation a very ſingular bleſſing of God.) This <hi>Domhnal</hi> I ſay, beſides his other great Vertues, is moſt deſervedly celebrated for a very great Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar of Chriſtian humility and contempt of himſelf. He had through human frailty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome fault; which, though I do not find expreſs'd or ſpecified what it was; I find notwithſtanding the rareſt inſtance of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſubmiſſion and humiliation of a King in him, that could be, to procure the forgiveneſs of it from his own Subject, tho a holy man of that Nation, call'd St. <hi>Fechinus.</hi> For, after earneſt humble entreaties to this man of God for pardon, when he had found him back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtill, and hard to relent, he proſtrated himſelf on the ground at his feet, and ſuffered him to tread on his bare neck.</p>
               <p>67. My next additional Note although of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Subject, tends nevertheleſs very much to the magnifying of the <hi>Ancient Iriſh,</hi> as to that natural heroick Vertue which next to the favour of Heaven preſerv'd them for ſo many Ages a Free Nation; Martial courage and Valour I mean. And therefore this Addition muſt relate to thoſe <hi>pages,</hi> where (from 25
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:102628:273"/> to 40.) I treated before, of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Wars in <hi>Ireland.</hi> However, it is ſuch an addition to the brave performances of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in thoſe Wars, that I know not whether it be not the greateſt of them all. I am ſure that as it was very great indeed: ſo the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to a Foreiner, namely <hi>Adolphus Cypreus,</hi> for tranſmitting the remembrance of it to Poſterity, in his Annals of the Biſhops of <hi>Sleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> a City in <hi>Denmark.</hi> For theſe are his own <hi>Latin</hi> words in the <hi>ſixth page</hi> of that Work: <hi>Reynerus Rex Danorum</hi> LVI. <hi>potentiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus, qui tamen ab excitata fortuna, quae ipſi in ſubjugandis Regnis Sueciae, Ruſſiae, Angliae, Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, Norvegiae, &amp; Hiberniae plurimum favit, ad inclinatam &amp; pene jacentem deſcivit.

For being taken by <hi>Hella</hi> King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he died there in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon about the year 841.</q> And yet I muſt obſerve here with <hi>Gratianus Lucius,</hi> 1. That <hi>Cypreus</hi> miſtook both the name and quality of him that took Priſoner this great <hi>Daniſh</hi> King. 2. That no King of <hi>Ireland</hi> nor Provincial,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:102628:273"/> nor even other leſſer King in <hi>Ireland</hi> was ever call'd by the name of <hi>Hella:</hi> nor was that name of any body at all known among the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> 3. That the right <hi>Iriſh</hi> name in all likelihood was <hi>Oillioll,</hi> which becauſe hard of pronuntiation, Foreiners miſtook or chang'd it to <hi>Hella.</hi> 4. That ſince Chriſtianity plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Countrey, not even any <hi>Oillioll</hi> was King among 'em, ſave only the Monarch <hi>Oil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioll</hi> (ſurnamed) <hi>Molt,</hi> who was next ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour to <hi>Laoghaire mhac Neill</hi> in the year 458. and was killed in Battel <hi>An.</hi> 478. And laſtly therefore, that he muſt have been ſome great General of an Army, and his name <hi>Oillioll,</hi> that took this great <hi>Reynerus,</hi> and kept him in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon till he died.</p>
               <p>68. Another is of the <hi>Fatal Stone,</hi> as they call it, and refers to <hi>page</hi> 378. where I ended my Animadverſions on the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Hiſtories con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Fergus</hi> I. Of that famed Stone, <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> in his Relations of the People call'd <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath De Dainainn,</hi> gives this account. 1. That this Nation, who were the laſt poſſeſſors of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> immediately before the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Race, had on their arrival there from <hi>Norway</hi> brought with them four ſpecial Jewels of extraordinary uſe: namely, a Sword, Lance, Pot, and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Stone,</hi> which in <hi>Iriſh</hi> they call by one name <hi>Liath Fail;</hi> by an other, <hi>Cloch na Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neamhna,</hi> this later importing in Engliſh, the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:102628:274"/> 
                  <hi>Stone of Deſtiny,</hi> or <hi>Fortune.</hi> 2. That after the <hi>Mileſiaus</hi> had conquer'd thoſe <hi>Tuath-Da-Danan,</hi> and conſequently got poſſeſſion of this Stone, and after they had not only plac'd it at <hi>Teambhuir</hi> (our <hi>Tarach</hi>) where all their Nobles and people did uſually meet to chuſe the King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but ordain'd that the new Elect ſhould ſit thereon: as ſon as he did ſo, the Stone under him, by vertue of ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical or Diabolical Charm, gave ſuch a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty loud ecchoing, aſtoniſhing ſound, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Election was known thereby far and near. 3.

That for many enſuing Ages it remain'd there for a monument (either of Religion or Superſtition) being in the ſame manner, and to the ſame purpoſe ſate upon by the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> till <hi>Edward</hi> I. of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the current of his Victories had it brought away out of the Abbey of <hi>Scone</hi> to the Abbey of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Where, ever ſince, it has been kept, placed under the Royal Chair which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> uſually ſit in at their Coronation. 7. That in the memory
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:102628:275"/> of our Fathers, that prophetical Prediction of it and the ancient <hi>Scots,</hi> which you have but now ſeen, was fulfill'd in <hi>England</hi> too, when <hi>James</hi> VI. of <hi>Scotland</hi> was crowned King of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and has ever ſince continued to be more and more verified in the ſucceſſion of <hi>Charles</hi> I. of glorious memory, and <hi>Charles</hi> II. our preſent moſt gracious King. For by the line of <hi>Maine mhic Cuirek, mhic Luighc,</hi> they are deſcended through a World of Generations of ancient <hi>Scots</hi> the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Iriſh, from <hi>Heber,</hi> who (as has been already noted elſewhere) being the ſon of <hi>Mileſius,</hi> and in a joint Sovereignty ruling with his Brother <hi>Herimon,</hi> was three thouſand years ſince King of all <hi>Ireland.</hi> And this is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which <hi>Keting</hi> (where he treats of <hi>Tuath-De-Danainn</hi>) gives of that <hi>fatal Stone.</hi> Save only that he makes no expreſs mention of <hi>Charles</hi> II. nor could indeed, as who died himſelf in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> I. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he expreſs'd his mind ſufficiently, as to the purpoſe of that Fatal Prediction, by naming his Father and Grandfather both. I am ſure his expreſſion of joy in the ſame place, for their having ſucceſſively come to be Kings of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> muſt have involv'd the concomitant wiſhes of his heart for their poſterity after them to attain and continue the ſame glory

               <p>69. The Fifth may be referr'd to <hi>page</hi> 155. where I treated briefly ſomewhat of <hi>Cormock O Cuillenain</hi> that excellent, pious, holy man, who was at the ſame time both Arch-Biſhop and King of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> and continued ſo for ſeven years together, that is, even all along till he loſt his life in the Battel of <hi>Mughna.</hi> For to this rare Example of the ſame man's being both King and Prieſt, may be added one more of the ſame Nature; and in the very ſame Kingdom of <hi>Mounſter</hi> too. Where, as <hi>Keting</hi> acquaints us, upon the Death of <hi>Duibh Lachne</hi> next Succeſſour in that Provincial Kingdom to <hi>Cormock O Cuilleinan</hi> for ſeven years more, the Princes and Gentry meeting choſe another Prieſt, nay a Monk to be their King, even the Abbot of <hi>Inis Catha,</hi> by name <hi>Flaithhiortach mhac Jonm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For he was taken Priſoner in it, and as ſuch detain'd
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:102628:276"/> ſome time at <hi>Kildare</hi> by that <hi>Leinſter</hi> King, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at the interceſſion of the Abbeſs of Saint <hi>Bridgets</hi> Monaſtery in that Town, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed and return'd to his own Abbey of <hi>Inis-Catha</hi> in <hi>Mounſter.</hi> Whence after ſome few years, wholly employ'd there in rigid aſcetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, he was call'd upon and e'en compell'd to take the Royal State of a King. So ſays <hi>Keting</hi> in his Reign of the ſaid Monarch <hi>Flann.</hi> Where alſo he notes occaſionally an other great Errour of <hi>Hanmer</hi> in his Chronicle. For <hi>Hanmer</hi> (page 88.) ſays, that both the foreſaid <hi>Cormock O Cuillenain</hi> King of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> (but he makes him King of <hi>Ireland</hi>) and <hi>Cearbhall O Muirreigein</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter</hi> were kill'd by the <hi>Danes</hi> in the year of our Lord 905. Whereas on the contrary, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Cearbhall</hi> kill'd in that year, nor that Battel fought of either ſide by the <hi>Danes,</hi> but of one ſide by the Monarch, and of the other by <hi>Cormock</hi> who periſh'd therein. All which is abundantly teſtified by the Authentick <hi>Iriſh</hi> Book of that very Battel, which Book has for Title, <hi>Catha Bheala Mughna.</hi> Beſides, as <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> obſerves in the ſame place, the <hi>Danes</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted nothing at all, no not once againſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> during the ſeven years Reign of <hi>Cormock O Cuillenain</hi> over <hi>Mounſter.</hi> Nay, there was ſo general a peace over all <hi>Ireland</hi> for this time, ſo great plenty of all earthly
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:102628:276"/> bleſſings, ſo univerſal a Reformation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſo much devotion and zeal in all ſorts of people for reſtoring what had been deſtroy'd by the firſt <hi>Daniſh</hi> Wars and other attempts following it, that nothing was to be ſeen more frequent now than every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the old, and building new Churches, Colledges, Hoſpitals, Monaſteries. Yea, the numbers of men dedicated only to a religious life was ſuch at this time, that <hi>Cormock O Cuillenainn</hi> tells in his <hi>Pſalter</hi> of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> that in <hi>Muingharid</hi> (formerly call'd the City of <hi>Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaine-aſſain</hi>) there was a Monaſtery with ſix Churches belonging to it in the ſame Town, wherein the number of Conventual Monks was 1500. whereof five hundred were learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Preachers, five hundred Pſalmiſts to ſerve conſtantly in the Choire, and four hundred old Fathers applied wholly to Contemplation. Such was the happy ſtate of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the ſhort Reign of the ſame <hi>Cormock</hi> over <hi>Mounſter;</hi> which muſt have been at or a little before the year of Chriſt 914. becauſe this year ended the thirty eight years long Reign of the Monarch <hi>Flann mhac Sionna,</hi> who kill'd in Battel that good King <hi>Cormock,</hi> as we have ſeen before.</p>
               <p>70. The Sixth being an addition to what has been ſaid before againſt <hi>Hanmer,</hi> page 403. gives you to underſtand, How <hi>Dionbhuillach,</hi> ſon to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> invading <hi>Ireland</hi>

               <p>71. My ſeventh Note, being likewiſe an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to ſupply what I purpoſely omitted in my 17th Page. There I mention'd occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the <hi>Picts</hi> arriving in <hi>Ireland</hi> out of <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi> ſo long ſince as the Reign of <hi>Herimon,</hi> the firſt <hi>Mileſian</hi> Monarch of that Kingdom; but little more of 'em, ſave only their being made Tributary ſome Ages after in <hi>Scotland</hi> by the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> Indeed when I writ and printed that <hi>Page,</hi> I did not think of enlarging as I have done ſince. And therefore partly for haſte, and partly for compendiouſneſs, I paſs'd then over ſeveral particulars, which I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me that very time in <hi>Keting,</hi> and he has at large in the foreſaid Reign, concerning thoſe <hi>Picts.</hi> But ſeeing I have ſince, though contrary to my firſt deſign, dilated on other matters: I think it not amiſs to add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more of that <hi>Pictiſh Nation.</hi> And this for two reaſons. The firſt is, becauſe 'tis not only of all hands confeſs'd, the <hi>Picts</hi> had been
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:102628:278"/> a <hi>warlike ancient People;</hi> but <hi>Venerable Bede</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them as <hi>moſt powerful</hi> too in the year of Chriſt 569. In which year, ſpeaking of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumb Cille</hi>'s landing in their Country from <hi>Ireland</hi> to convert 'em, he has theſe very words, <hi>Regnante Pictis Bridio, filio Meilochon, Rege po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiſſimo,</hi> &amp;c. The ſecond: Becauſe both the time of their firſt appearing in theſe parts, and their very Original, <hi>i. e.</hi> what Country-men they were, or whence they came, have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for many Ages hitherto, at leaſt of late they are vexatious Queſtions. As may be ſeen in <hi>Cambden's Britannia;</hi> where he has given a <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Picts</hi> and four <hi>pages</hi> (in <hi>Holland</hi>'s Tranſlation of him) to reſolvetheſe Queſtions. Though, after all, he ſeems to me no nearer the Truth in his conjectural deciſion of either the one or the other, then <hi>Buchanan</hi> has before him; nay wider from it as to the later Queſtion, than either <hi>Campion</hi> or <hi>Hanmer,</hi> or any other follow'd by them. Theſe, for ſo much, had the good luck to yield to the Authority of <hi>V. Bede.</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſ. Hiſtor. l. 1. c.</hi> 1. where he expreſly tells us to this purpoſe, 1. That when the ancient <hi>Britons</hi> had poſſeſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Southern Parts of this Noble Iſland, which derives its name from them, it happen'd that the Nation of <hi>Picts</hi> departing from <hi>Scythia,</hi> entring the Ocean, wind-driven to <hi>Ireland,</hi> landing there, deſiring the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:102628:278"/> the <hi>Scots</hi> to afford 'em Elbow-room for Cohabitation; and being denied this, but nevertheleſs directed by 'em to the Northern Tract of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and withal promis'd their aſſiſtance (if need ſhould be) to conquer it by force: they by this direction and promiſe encourag'd, put to Sea preſently for that ſame Northern Tract; and landing therein, made it their habitation. 2. That wanting Women, and deſiring Wives of the <hi>Scots,</hi> they had 'em on this condition, That whenever the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Crown amongſt their People ſhould chance to be controverted, the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male's line Royal ſhould prevail, and the King be choſen thence. Which is even to this day obſerv'd among the <hi>Picts,</hi> ſays <hi>Bede,</hi> ſpeaking of his own time. 3. That they had a peculiar Language of their own. For (in the ſame <hi>Chapter</hi>) he notes particularly, how accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of the Five Books (of <hi>Moſes</hi>) wherein the Divine Law had been written, <hi>Brittain</hi> in his time praiſed God in five divers Languages; <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, Britons, Scots, Picts,</hi> and <hi>Latins;</hi> this laſt made common to them all by their ſtudying the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding this plain account of the <hi>Picts,</hi> given by <hi>V. Bede,</hi> as to their great Antiquity or Time of their firſt appearance in theſe Weſtern Iſlands, and the Countrey,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:102628:279"/> whence they came to them, being that of <hi>Scythia:</hi> not only <hi>Buchanan,</hi> but <hi>Cambden</hi> by little Criticiſms and other weak conjectures would fain perſuade us they had only been a part of the ancient <hi>Britons</hi> retired from the South and power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions in the ſame Iſland of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> &amp;c. into the more uncouth inacceſſible Northern parts thereof. That they were no earlier known by the name of <hi>Picts,</hi> than the Reign of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours <hi>Diocletian</hi> and <hi>Maximian Herculeus.</hi> And that their Language differ'd not in ſubſtance but only in a certain kind of Dialect from the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Tongue ſpoken by the reſt of their Countrey-men the other <hi>Brittons.</hi> But the words of <hi>Bede</hi> are clearer, and his authority greater than the arguments they bring are able to elude or impeach. Nor indeed can any thing more be deſired to end theſe two vexatious Queſtions concerning that <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Nation, ſave only the particulars given by <hi>Keting</hi> out of the moſt ancient authentick Records of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Theſe are of ſuch irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable authority, that I am perſuaded, were they known to <hi>Cambden,</hi> he had never diſputed the matter. At leaſt I believe he ſhould not, if he had well conſider'd of it. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> were the Nation, that, by the confeſſion of all ſides, from the beginning preſs'd longeſt and hardeſt of any upon that Northern Countrey inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:102628:279"/> by the <hi>Picts</hi> in <hi>Great Brittain.</hi> They were the Nation that by degrees conquer'd ſo many of their Provinces, planted ſo many Colonies in 'em, eſtabliſh'd a King of their own over the ſame Provinces long before the <hi>Romans</hi> attack'd either. Yea, they were the Nation that utterly ſubdued at laſt the whole <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kingdom and extinguiſh'd in it the very name of <hi>Picts.</hi> Wherefore it is plain, that as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were moſt concern'd, ſo they had the beſt means of any to know both the time of their firſt appearance, and Countrey too from whence they came: as the <hi>Picts</hi> themſelves were pleas'd to tell 'em. And ſeeing it is no leſs plain, out of what has been ſaid elſewhere in theſe Diſcourſes, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation in all times had their publick Regiſters, wherein with the greateſt care and certainty could be, all the Concerns of their People both at home and abroad, together with all other matters they thought fit, were recorded: it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that their account of the <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Nation, as to thoſe two controverted points, ought in reaſon to ſilence any other fancied by men of later days. Now in that <hi>Iriſh</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, beſides what you have ſeen already out of <hi>Venerable Bede,</hi> there are many more particulars, given at large by <hi>Keting</hi> out of the <hi>Pſalter</hi> of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> whereof the chief heads are theſe: 1. That in <hi>Thracia</hi> this People we
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:102628:280"/> call <hi>Picts</hi> ſerving <hi>Policornus,</hi> the King of that Countrey, in his Wars, for pay, but under a General and other Commanders of their own: it happen'd that their General, whoſe name was <hi>Gud,</hi> underſtanding for certain how the King had deſign'd to raviſh his beautiful Daughter, if he could not otherwiſe make her his Whore, prevented him by taking away his Life. 2. That thereupon this <hi>Gud,</hi> flying immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with thoſe of his Soldiery who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to run his fortune, put to Sea where he found convenience, and roam'd up and down till he arriv'd in <hi>Gaule:</hi> where being well entertain'd by the King of that Kingdom, his Daughter's beauty prov'd the ſecond time his bane, after he had built, or at leaſt began the building of <hi>Pictavis,</hi> from his People ſo called; (we call it now <hi>Poictiers.</hi>) For then obſerving that this <hi>Gauliſh</hi> King alſo had the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon her that the <hi>Thracian</hi> had, he ſaw there was no abiding there without ſacrificing her honour to his Luſt. And therefore in all haſte, but as privately as he could, he put to Sea again with his own People, where he was toſs'd ſo long till the occaſion of all his woe his beautiful Daughter died; and ſoon after he and his People arriv'd ſafe in <hi>Ireland,</hi> at a place call'd in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tongue <hi>Inbher Slaine,</hi> or the Mouth of the River <hi>Slane</hi> in <hi>Leinſter,</hi> which now we call the Haven of <hi>Weixford.</hi>
                  <pb n="493" facs="tcp:102628:280"/> 3. That one by name <hi>Criomthann Sciatbheal,</hi> being then Commander of <hi>Leinſter</hi> under <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimon</hi> the Firſt <hi>Mileſian</hi> Monarch of <hi>Ireland,</hi> hearing of their landing, came to them: and ſeeing them brave men, entertain'd 'em wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly of purpoſe to aſſiſt him in fighting ſome <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Troops, whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Books call <hi>Tuath Fiodhgha,</hi> whoſe Lances and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows were poiſon'd to ſuch degree that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was wounded by 'em could have no cure but Death. 4. That after this League of Friendſhip made, one of the <hi>Picts,</hi> called <hi>Troſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> a great Magitian, underſtanding of the common danger from thoſe poiſon'd Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, advis'd the ſaid <hi>Leinſter</hi> Commander to provide againſt the day of Battel a 150 white, milch, crumple-horn'd Cows, to be milk'd all together when the Fight began; the Milk put into a Hole prepar'd of purpoſe hard by, and the wounded men to run preſently and bath therein: which being obſerv'd, the effect prov'd anſwerable to expectation, and the <hi>Brittains</hi> were quite overthrown, with the loſs of moſt of their Lives upon the ſpot. 5. That upon this ſucceſs, at leaſt not long after it, the <hi>Picts</hi> looking big, growing unruly, and even aſpiring to the Command of that whole Province of <hi>Leinſter;</hi> but the Monarch <hi>Herimon,</hi> made acquainted with it, drawing together a greater Power then they dared fight,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:102628:281"/> they were compell'd to accept of his Terms, and hye them away out of hand with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and aſſiſtance for the Northern parts of <hi>Great Brittain.</hi> 6. That nevertheleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their departure they obtain'd of <hi>Herimon</hi> three <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ladies, by name <hi>Beanbhreaſi, Bean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bhuais,</hi> and <hi>Beanbhuaiſdhne,</hi> who had been the Widows of three of <hi>Herimons</hi> Commanders, and taken theſe names from 'em, kill'd in the late War with <hi>Tuath-De-Danann:</hi> and theſe were all the Women they could obtain (at leaſt then) though upon that very condition told us by <hi>Bede.</hi> The firſt of 'em married to <hi>Cathluan</hi> the chief Commander now of the <hi>Picts:</hi> for it ſeems his Father <hi>Gud</hi> was before this time departed the World: the other two married to two more of their Nobles. Nor could any of them obtain leave to ſtay in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but only ſix, <hi>viz. Troſdan</hi> the foreſaid Magitian, <hi>Soilean, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpre, Neachtan Nar, Aon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and <hi>Leatan:</hi> who had poſſeſſions given them for ever by <hi>Herimon</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Breagh Mhoigh,</hi> now call'd by us <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Meath.</hi> 6. That the foreſaid <hi>Cathluan</hi> was the firſt King of the <hi>Picts</hi> in <hi>Cruithin-Tuath,</hi> or <hi>Tuath Chruinigh</hi> (for by both theſe compound names indifferently the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Books call that Countrey in the North of <hi>Brittain</hi> which the <hi>Picts</hi> erected to a Kingdom, and call it ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough, as importing in <hi>Engliſh</hi> the <hi>Lordſhip

That after him in a ſucceſſion reign'd in the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey (at leaſt in ſome part of it) and of the ſame <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Nation, Threeſcore and Ten Kings more, to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the laſt of 'em.</p>
               <p>And theſe being the Heads of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars that concern them in the <hi>Pſalter</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel,</hi> written by the Holy <hi>Cormock O Cuilenain</hi> Arch Biſhop and King of <hi>Mounſter</hi> eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſince, and by conſequence written either immediately before or immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (I am ſure much about) the time of their laſt fatal overthrow by his Countrey men the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and their Iſſue in <hi>Scotland;</hi> we need no longer queſtion either the time of that <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Nation's firſt appearance, or the Countrey they came from to the Weſtern parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> As neither indeed whence they deriv'd the cuſtom of painting themſelves. They might have learn'd this from the <hi>Agathyrſi</hi> in <hi>Thracia,</hi> if themſelves had it not before: yea, they might be the firſt that us'd it in <hi>Great Brittain;</hi> and the <hi>Brittons</hi> might have only had it from them, for any thing ſaid to the contrary. And they came as early to <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> both as the Reign of <hi>Herinton</hi> the firſt <hi>Mileſian</hi> Monarch of <hi>Ireland,</hi> after he
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:102628:282"/> had kill'd his elder Brother <hi>Heber,</hi> to whom he was but joyn'd in Sovereignty while <hi>Heber</hi> lived. Nay, we need not queſtion how long this <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kingdom laſted. For ſeeing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at leaſt as early as <hi>Herimon</hi>'s death, I mean by this account in the <hi>Pſalter</hi> of <hi>Caſhel;</hi> and that, by Primat <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhers</hi> account, it continued to the year of Chriſt 840. then we muſt conclude, that according to <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi>'s computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the years of the World, and years alſo of all the ſeveral <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarchs Reigns, the <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kingdom laſted 2623 years in all. For this Author fixes the death of <hi>Herimon</hi> in the year of the World 3516. and the Birth of Chriſt in the year 5199. as <hi>Euſebius Caeſarienſis,</hi> one of the Fathers of the firſt General Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> did long before him.</p>
               <p>What more I have to ſay in reference to the <hi>Picts,</hi> their Kingdom, or Kings, is, That as I was writing this Reflection, Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Hiſtory of <hi>England</hi> being brought me by chance, and looking it over, I obſerv'd, That altho the ingenious Author gives no more light therein concerning the Countrey whence thoſe <hi>Picts</hi> came firſt to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and thence to <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor of their Leaders name, nor of the time of their arrival amongſt us, than other late Writers, eſpecially <hi>Campion</hi> and <hi>Hanmer</hi> did before him, who call that Leader King <hi>Roderick,</hi>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:102628:282"/> and ſay this <hi>Roderick</hi> came to <hi>Ireland</hi> from <hi>Scandia</hi> (alias <hi>Scandinavia</hi>) which goes under the name of <hi>Scythia Germanica,</hi> or the <hi>German Scythia:</hi> yet he gives therein (<hi>page</hi> 197) a Catalogue of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Kings, and years of their ſeveral Reigns, partly out of <hi>John For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s M. S. <hi>Scoto-Chronicon;</hi> and partly out of <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> who adds to the 76 Kings in <hi>Fordon,</hi> five more. So that both numbers, put together, make juſt the very ſame number of <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kings, which the <hi>Pſalter</hi> of <hi>Caſhel</hi> has. Though I muſt confeſs there is no other agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any point between that <hi>Pſalter</hi> &amp; theſe Authors, either as to the names of thoſe Kings, or years of their Reigns, or total ſum of theſe years. Neither is there in that whole Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue any <hi>Roderick</hi> either as firſt or laſt, or any at all of them, nor any thing near his name. The very ſame you may aſſure your ſelf of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thluan:</hi> whom nevertheleſs you have ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, out of the <hi>Pſalter</hi> of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> to have been the firſt <hi>Pictiſh</hi> King. As for the total ſum of the years of their Reign, which by caſting it up out of the ſeveral Reigns every body may ſee is 1165. it plainly comes ſhort, by 1452 years, of the former account derivable from the <hi>Pſalter</hi> of <hi>Caſhel,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> &amp; <hi>Lucius.</hi> Beſides it neceſſarily muſt ſuppoſe the <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kingdom began in <hi>Scotland</hi> e'en four hundred

As for the names expreſs'd in that Catalogue, all I can ſay is, that if we give credit to <hi>Nennius,</hi> a <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Author that liv'd (as himſelf writes) <hi>an. Chriſti</hi> 830. under <hi>Anaraugh</hi> King of <hi>Angleſey</hi> and <hi>Guinech:</hi> if beſides we ſuppoſe his Book rightly tranſlated into <hi>Iriſh</hi> in <hi>O Duvegans Miſcellanies:</hi> and if withal we believe, that <hi>Gratianus Lucius,</hi> quoting both, would not impoſe upon us, nor I on you or my ſelf: what follows muſt be, That we give no kind of credit to the foreſaid Catalogue drawn out of <hi>Fordon</hi> and <hi>Boethius,</hi> not even (I mean) as to thoſe names of the <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kings contain'd therein. For the ſame <hi>Gratianus Lucius,</hi> after letting us know (in his <hi>Cambr. Everſ. page</hi> 93.) That himſelf had a Copy of thoſe <hi>Miſcellanies,</hi> and among 'em the Catalogue of all the <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kings, written by the ſaid <hi>Nennius,</hi> then preſently, though upon another occaſion, names five and forty of 'em: and I am ſure that of this very number (tho only a part of <hi>Nennius</hi>'s Catalogue) there are at leaſt ſix and twenty names that have no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with, no reſemblance at all nor imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any in the whole Bed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Eighth Note. Which, as it refers to ſeveral places of this Book, particularly to <hi>page</hi> 5. and all other <hi>pages</hi> indeed where I ſuppoſe the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſians</hi> either to have poſſeſs'd themſelves of <hi>Ireland</hi> as early as the year of the World 2736. or not to have continued longer a free People under their own Laws and Kings then about 2500 years: ſo it is meerly occaſion'd by what I ſaid but now in my <hi>Seventh Note</hi> concerning the extent of time, which the <hi>Pictiſh</hi> Kings muſt have laſted according to the Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher.</hi> In ſhort, I muſt on this occaſion tell you here, That as to the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Kingdom's anſwerable extent of Time, <hi>Keting</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> agree. Save only, That <hi>Keting</hi> (as himſelf profeſſes in his <hi>Preface</hi>) following that computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the years of the World, which allows only 4052 years from the <hi>Creation</hi> to the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and conſequently in this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort 1138 years, of the computation of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> would needs reform the <hi>Iriſh Regnal</hi> (for ſo they call the Book of their Reigns) by ſhortning the Reigns of ſeveral of their Monarchs, by ſo many years in all as amount to above four hundred, that is, 491 years, and this of purpoſe to make the whole
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:102628:284"/> extent of Time and the ſeveral Periods from the firſt Plantation of <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Partholan</hi> to the Reign of <hi>Ruaruidh O Conchabhar</hi> the Laſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monarch of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Race, agree the better with his own foreſaid <hi>Computation</hi> of the years of the World. And <hi>Lucius,</hi> on the other ſide, as he follow'd <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſame years of the World, (which is that commonly follow'd by both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> ſays <hi>Sixtus Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Biblioth. <hi>S. l. 2. page</hi> 46. verb. Adae Genealogia.</note>:) ſo he held ſtiffly and throughly to the <hi>Iriſh Regnal</hi> as to the years of each <hi>Mileſian</hi> Monarch's Reign. And therefore the difference 'twixt theſe two Writers, in relation to <hi>Ireland,</hi> or to any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod or extent of the periods of Time ſince its firſt Plantation, is only that of near five hundred years during the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Monarchy. In all other points, concerning this matter, they both agree. As for Example, That <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was firſt planted by <hi>Partholan,</hi> about three hundred years after the <hi>Deluge:</hi> that his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity continued there three hundred years: and the next Invaders <hi>Clanna Neimheadh</hi> 217 more: and after them, the Nation call'd <hi>Fir-bholg,</hi> thirty ſix: and after theſe, another Nation, by name <hi>Tuath-De-Danann,</hi> for 197 years: and then immediately the <hi>Mileſians</hi>
                  <pb n="501" facs="tcp:102628:284"/> coming in, continued ſince to the year of Chriſt 1172. So that <hi>Keting</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throughly agreed in all theſe points: their difference about the whole extent (of their ſeveral periods) mention'd before, can be no other than that of <hi>Keting</hi>'s voluntary cutting off from the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Reigns about five hundred years. Or rather indeed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if we conſider how <hi>Keting</hi> himſelf confeſſes he did ſo, and for what end he did it, even contrary to the <hi>Iriſh Regnall,</hi> we may conclude there is no difference at all as to the undoubted extent of all thoſe ſeveral Periods of Time; though <hi>Keting</hi> place the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Epocha in his year of the World 2736. and <hi>Lucius</hi> the very ſame Epocha in his year of the World, 3500. For albeit this diverſity of placing it argues 1172. years difference between 'em in ſtating the years of the World: and that <hi>Keting</hi> choſe rather to follow the far more likely computation of <hi>Auguſtinus Torniellius</hi> (in his <hi>Annales Sacri &amp; Profani</hi>

                  </note>: yet no difference at all, as to ſtating ſtrictly the extent of Time or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years which the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſian</hi> or other former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts or Plantations of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had continued, can be deduced thence. Only it argues, that either the one or other was miſtaken in the number of the years of the <hi>World,</hi> or in fixing 'em. Which is enough to be ſaid on this Subject oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally. And therefore I will only add here what as occaſionally comes now to mind. That whether (in my <hi>Title-page</hi>) by the year of the World, 2736, you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the year accounted ſuch according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Torniellius</hi> and <hi>Keting,</hi> or the other accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch by <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Lucius:</hi> I am neither way
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:102628:285"/> my ſelf, nor any thing in this Book concern'd. Though otherwiſe I would, as to this point, much rather hold with thoſe, than theſe: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nevertheleſs all due veneration to the name of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> as who had been not only one of the Three hundred and eighteen <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, and Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Paleſtin,</hi> but worthy (as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> ſaid of him) to be Biſhop of the whole <hi>Earth.</hi>

               <p>The Ninth and laſt Additional Note has no reference (that I can remember) to any thing ſaid before in any of my <hi>pages.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I give it, becauſe I ſee <hi>Gratianus Lucius</hi> thought it not unconducing to the honour of the <hi>Ancient Iriſh.</hi> For it is in ſhort: That the Warlike Nation of the <hi>Heruli</hi> who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited ſome Northern Iſlands and other Tracts near <hi>Germany,</hi> a Nation too well ſometimes known to the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces harraſs'd by them, did glory in their two Kings <hi>Dathen</hi> and <hi>Aordon,</hi> as deſcended from the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> and that <hi>Suria,</hi> born of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lady deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Kings of <hi>Ireland,</hi> had the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preain Power of <hi>Biſcay</hi> an. 870, as abſolute Princeſs thereof, which ſhe tranſmitted to a long ſucceſſion of Deſcendants from her.

               <p>And ſo (Reader) you have at laſt an end of all my additional Notes, and conſequently of all whatever I thought neceſſary to ſay (according to the deſign and method of this little <hi>Tract</hi>) of the <hi>Ancient Iriſh,</hi> as they were a free Nation about 2500 years under their own Laws and Government.
